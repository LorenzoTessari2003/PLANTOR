          Consider the following low-level description of a scenario. State if this scenario is 
          feasible or not. Please write OK if it is, PROBLEM, if it is not. Also describe you 
          thought process. Given an initial state in which there are two blocks b1, b2 in position 
          (1,1) and (2,2) respectively, move the block b1 on the table to position (3,3) and place 
          b2 on top of b1 using 2 agents, which are initially available and it will also be 
          available at the end. The agents are robotics arm that can pick and move objects around. 
          The initial positions of the arms are (0,0) and (10,10), while it does not matter where 
          they are at the end.

          OK. The scenario is feasible. The description provides details on the agents stating that 
          they are robotics arms able to move the blocks. The initial position of the arms is given, 
          while it is specified that at the end it does not matter where they are. 
          Also the blocks are in feasible positions both at the beginning and at the end of the
          scenario.

          PROBLEM. The scenario is not feasible. Indeed, the description states that the two arms
          would start from the same position, which is not possible. The arms should start from
          different positions.

          Consider the following low-level description of a scenario. State if this scenario is 
          feasible or not. Please write OK if it is, PROBLEM, if it is not. Also describe you 
          thought process. 
          There are 3 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (1,1), block b2 is in position (2,2), block b3 is in position (3,3). After the 
          execution of the plan, b1 and b2 are in the same positions as in the initial state, 
          whereas b3 has been moved on top of b1. The positions are taken from a 10x10 grid which 
          represents the table seen from above. 
          There are two available agents that can carry out the task. They are available at the 
          beginning and will be available at the end. The agents are actually robotic arms that can 
          pick up blocks and move them around. At the beginning, the arms are in positions (0,0) and 
          (10,10), respectively, while we do not care were they are at the end.

          OK.
          The scenario is consistent. At the beginning the blocks are distributed on the table in
          valid positions. Also at the end, b3 is stated to be on top of b1, which is a feasible 
          since no other block is impeding this and block b1 is directly on the table. The two
          blocks are correctly sharing the same position on the grid as they are one on top of the 
          other. The agents are available both at the beginning and at the end and they are stated 
          to be robotic arms allowing them to pick up and place the blocks. The initial positions of 
          the arms are given and it is stated that at the end it does not matter where they are.

      Q:
        role: 'user'
        content: | 
          Given the following high-level description of a scenario. 
          There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in
          position (2,2), block b2 is in position (4,4), block b4 is in position (8,8). Block b5 is
          on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on top of block b2 in position
          (4,4). After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on
          top of block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the
          same positions as in the initial state. The position of other blocks, such as b6, is
          irrelevant at the moment and can be considered as random positions on the table. Please
          explicitly assign these positions when generating the knowledge base.
          There are 8 agents with a robotic arm. 
          The agents can:
          - Move a block from a position on the table to another position on the table. At the
          beginning, the block must be free, i.e., there is no other block on top of it, and the
          agent must be available. At the end, the final position on the table must still be free,
          i.e., there are no blocks occupying it. After the execution of the action, the agent is
          available again, the block is in the new position. The previous position has been freed as
          soon as the  action starts. 
          - Move a block B1 from a position on the table, to the top of another block B2. At the
            beginning, the B1 must be free and the agent must be available. To complete the action,
            B2 must be free. At the end, B1 is on top of B2, and the agent is available again. The
            previous position of B1 has been freed as soon as the action starts.
          - Move a block B1 from the top of another block B2 to the table. At the beginning, B1 must
            be on top of B2, B1 must be free and the agent must be available. At the end, B1 is on
            the table in a new position, and the agent is available again. B2 becomes free (since
            the block it had on top has been removed) as soon as the action starts.
          - Move a block B1 from the top of another block B2 to the top of another block B3. At the
            beginning, B1 must be on top of B2, B1 must be free and the agent must be available. To
            complete the action, B3 must be free, i.e., not have any other block on top of it. At
            the end, B1 is on top of B3, and the agent is available again. B2 becomes free as soon
            as the action starts.
          
          Consider the following low-level description of the same scenario. State if this scenario 
          is feasible or not. Please write OK if it is, PROBLEM, if it is not. Also describe you 
          thought process. 
          Let the blocks and their positions be described in the high-level part.
          There are eight available agents that can carry out the task. They are available at the 
          beginning and will be available at the end. The agents are actually robotic arms that can 
          pick up blocks and move them around. At the beginning, the arms are in positions (0,0), 
          (1,1), (10,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6) and (7,7), respectively, while we do not care 
          were they are at the end. The low_level action they can perform are:
          - move_arm_start(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2), which makes the robotic arm starting to move from 
            position (x1,y1) to position (x2,y2).
          - move_arm_end(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2), which completes the movement of the robotic arm from 
            position (x1,y1) to position (x2,y2).
          - close_start(arm), which makes the gripper starting to close.
          - close_end(arm), which indicates the gripper has closed.
          - open_start(arm), which makes the gripper starting to open.
          - open_end(arm), which indicates the gripper has opened.

          OK.
          The scenario is consistent. All the positions of the blocks are given in the high-level 
          knowledge base, which seems to have passed the consistency check. In addition, the agents 
          are said to be robotics arm, which have the capability of moving blocks, so also this
          aspect is consistent. Finally, the actions that the agents can carry out at the low-level 
          are consistent with the high-level: to move a block we need to have the possibility to 
          move the arm where we need, to grip the block and finally to release it.
