          Consider the following low-level description of a scenario. State if this scenario is 
          feasible or not. Please write OK if it is, PROBLEM, if it is not. Also describe you 
          thought process. Given an initial state in which there are two blocks b1, b2 in position 
          (1,1) and (2,2) respectively, move the block b1 on the table to position (3,3) and place 
          b2 on top of b1 using 2 agents, which are initially available and it will also be 
          available at the end. The agents are robotics arm that can pick and move objects around. 
          The initial positions of the arms are (0,0) and (10,10), while it does not matter where 
          they are at the end.

          OK. The scenario is feasible. The description provides details on the agents stating that 
          they are robotics arms able to move the blocks. The initial position of the arms is given, 
          while it is specified that at the end it does not matter where they are. 
          Also the blocks are in feasible positions both at the beginning and at the end of the
          scenario.

          PROBLEM. The scenario is not feasible. Indeed, the description states that the two arms
          would start from the same position, which is not possible. The arms should start from
          different positions.

          PROBLEM. The scenario is not feasible. Indeed, the description states that the agent is a 
          car-like robot. This type of agent is not able to pick and move objects around.

          Consider the following low-level description of a scenario. State if this scenario is 
          feasible or not. Please write OK if it is, PROBLEM, if it is not. Also describe you 
          thought process. 
          There are 3 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (1,1), block b2 is in position (2,2), block b3 is in position (3,3). After the 
          execution of the plan, b1 and b2 are in the same positions as in the initial state, 
          whereas b3 has been moved on top of b1. The positions are taken from a 10x10 grid which 
          represents the table seen from above. 
          There are two available agents that can carry out the task. They are available at the 
          beginning and will be available at the end. The agents are actually robotic arms that can 
          pick up blocks and move them around. At the beginning, the arms are in positions (0,0) and 
          (10,10), respectively, while we do not care were they are at the end.

          OK.
          The scenario is consistent. At the beginning the blocks are distributed on the table in
          valid positions. Also at the end, b3 is stated to be on top of b1, which is a feasible 
          since no other block is impeding this and block b1 is directly on the table. The two
          blocks are correctly sharing the same position on the grid as they are one on top of the 
          other. The agents are available both at the beginning and at the end and they are stated 
          to be robotic arms allowing them to pick up and place the blocks. The initial positions of 
          the arms are given and it is stated that at the end it does not matter where they are.
