          Consider the following description of a scenario. State if this scenario is feasible or
          not. Please write OK if it is, PROBLEM, if it is not. Also describe you thought process. 
          Given an initial state in which there are two blocks b1, b2 in position (1,1) and (2,2) 
          respectively, move the block b1 to position (3,3) and place b2 on top of b1 using an 
          agent, which is initially available and it will also be available at the end.

          OK. The scenario is feasible. The description provides the position of the blocks and 
          they are all separated correctly. It also provides information about the agents that 
          operate in the scenario.

          Given the following description of the environment, can you please state if the 
          description is consistent or if it contains errors? If it's fine, please write OK, 
          otherwise write PROBLEM. In both cases, please describe your thoughts.
          There are 3 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (2,2), block b2 is in position (4,4), block b4 is in position (8,8). 
          After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b1 on top of 
          block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b2 is in the same position as
          in the initial state.  
          There are 8 agents with a robotic arm.

          OK. 
          The description is consistent. The initial state describes the position of the blocks
          and the agent, and the final state describes the position of the blocks and the agent
          after the actions have been performed. 
          It's true that the description talks about 3 blocks and then mentions b1, b2, b4 and not
          b3, but it's possible that b3 is not relevant for the problem and the number of blocks
          is still correct.

          There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in

          on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on top of block b2 in position (4,4). 
          After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on top of 
          block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the same 
          positions as in the initial state. Other blocks, such as b6, are assigned random positions
          on the table. Please explicitly assign these positions.

          OK. 
          The description is consistent. The initial state describes the position of the blocks
          and the agent, and the final state describes the position of the blocks and the agent
          after the actions have been performed. While the positions of some blocks, such as b6 and 
          b7, are not directly described, it is stated that they can be assigned random positions 
          on the table as we do not care about them.

          There are 3 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (1,1), block b2 is on top of b1 in position (1,1), and block b3 is in position 
          (2,2). After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b1 on top
          of b2 in position (1,1) and b3 in position (2,2).

          PROBLEM. 
          The description is not consistent. The problem states that there are only two positions 
          on the table, (1,1) and (2,2). The difference between the initial and final states is
          that blocks b2 and b1 are swapped, but this is not possible since there are not enough
          positions on the table to carry out this action. Indeed, the only movement that frees b1
          is to place b2 on top of b3. But now, the only possible movement would be to place b1 on 
          top of b2, which is on top of b3. Since the stack is b3,b2,b1 from bottom to top, it's not
          possible to take b2 from under b1 and place it in (1,1) as the problem states.
          Moreover, there is just one agent available, meaning that it's not possible to use two
          agents to pick up both blocks and put them down in the correct order anyway.

          OK. 
          The description is consistent. The goal is to swap the positions of b1 and b2, which is
          possible since there is another free location that can be used to temporarily place a 
          block. The idea is either to put b2 on top of b3, or to put b2 in the free space in (3,3),
          then place b1 either on top of b3 or in the free space, depending on whether b2 was placed
          in (3,3) or on top of b3, respectively. Finally, the agent will place b2 first in (1,1) 
          and then b1 on top of b2 in (1,1).

          PROBLEM. 
          The description is not consistent. The goal states that both b2 and b3 are directly on top
          of b1 in position (1,1), which cannot be possible since two blocks cannot occupy the same 
          position at the same time.

          Given the following high-level description of the environment, can you please state if the

          otherwise write PROBLEM. In both cases, please describe your thoughts.
        
          There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (2,2), block b2 is in position (4,4), block b4 is in position (8,8). Block b5 is 
          on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on top of block b2 in position (4,4).
          After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on top of 
          block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the same 
          positions as in the initial state. The position of other blocks, such as b6, is irrelevant
          at the moment and can be considered as random positions on the table. Please explicitly 
          assign these positions when generating the knowledge base.
          There are 8 agents with a robotic arm.

          OK.
          The description is consistent. Even though just 5 out of the 7 blocks have been described,
          the position of the others is explicitly said to be irrelevant and that they can be 
          assigned random positions. The initial state describes the position of 5 out of the 7
          blocks. The remaining two blocks are said to not be relevant for the problem, and that 
          their positions can be assigned randomly. It will be my task to complete the 
          knowledge-base with random positions making it consistent. The final state describes the 
          position of the blocks after the actions have been performed highlighting the position of 
          the blocks that have changed. Finally, both the initial and final states describe the 
          number of agents available to perform the act

          The description is inconsistent. Even though the blocks have valid positions and there
          is an agent that can carry out the task, the final state is not reachable since the only
          positions specified are the ones where the blocks are and it is not possible to swap the
          blocks.

          The description is inconsistent. Even though it may SEEM to be unfeasible since the only 
          positions specified are the ones where the blocks are and it is not possible to swap the
          blocks, the fact that there are two agents available makes it possible to swap the blocks
          by making one of the agents pick up the blocks freeing one position to swap the blocks.
