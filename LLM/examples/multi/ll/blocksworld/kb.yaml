          Consider the following query for the high-level part:
          "There are 3 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (1,1), block b2 is in position (2,2), block b3 is in position (3,3). After the 
          execution of the plan, b1 on the table in position (1,1), b2 is on the table in position 
          (2,2) and b3 is on top of b1 in position (1,1). There are two available agents that can 
          carry out the task. They are available at the beginning and will be available at the end."
          And consider the following general knowledge base provided by the high-level:
          ```kb
          % Positions on the table
          pos(1,1).
          pos(2,2).
          pos(3,3).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).

          % Agents
          agent(a1).
          agent(a2).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```
          Now, consider the following query for the low-level part:
          "There are 3 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (1,1), block b2 is in position (2,2), block b3 is in position (3,3). After the 
          execution of the plan, b1 on the table in position (1,1), b2 is on the table in position
          (2,2) and b3 is on top of b1 in position (1,1). There are 2 agents with a robotic arm that
          are available at the beginning and will be available at the end, which can be used to pick
          objects.""
          Please update the high-level knowledge base to reflect the changes in the description for 
          the low-level, and identify new possible resources to be used.
          Remember to prepend the low-level predicates with "ll_" to avoid conflicts with the 
          high-level predicates.s

          Sure. The knowledge base provided in the high-level is updated as follows:
          ```kb
          % Positions on the table
          pos(1,1).
          pos(2,2).
          pos(3,3).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).

          % Agents
          agent(a1).
          agent(a2).

          % Arms
          ll_arm(a1).
          ll_arm(a2).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          resources(ll_arm(_)).
          ```
          The new knowledge base reflects the changes in the description for the low-level and 
          identifies new possible resources to be used. In particular, the new knowledge base 
          includes the arms that the agents have, which can be used to pick objects. These arms are
          also considered as resources that can be used in the task. In the description no other 
          change was made, so the knowledge base remains the same.
