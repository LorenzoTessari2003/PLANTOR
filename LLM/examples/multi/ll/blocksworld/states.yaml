          Consider the following query for the high-level part:
          "There are 3 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (1,1), block b2 is in position (2,2), block b3 is in position (3,3). After the 
          execution of the plan, b1 on the table in position (1,1), b2 is on the table in position 
          (2,2) and b3 is on top of b1 in position (1,1). There are two available agents that can 
          carry out the task. They are available at the beginning and will be available at the end."
          And consider the following general knowledge base provided by the high-level:
          ```kb
          % Positions on the table
          pos(1,1).
          pos(2,2).
          pos(3,3).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).

          % Agents
          agent(a1).
          agent(a2).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```
          and the following initial and final states:
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b3),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,3,3),
            clear(b1), clear(b2), clear(b3),
            available(a1), available(a2)

          goal_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), on(b3, b1),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,1,1),
            clear(b2), clear(b3),
            available(a1), available(a2)
          ]).
          ```
          Now, consider the following query for the low-level part:
          "There are 3 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (1,1), block b2 is in position (2,2), block b3 is in position (3,3). After the 
          execution of the plan, b1 on the table in position (1,1), b2 is on the table in position
          (2,2) and b3 is on top of b1 in position (1,1). There are 2 agents with a robotic arm that
          are available at the beginning and will be available at the end, which can be used to pick
          objects. Their initial position is (0,0) for agent a1 and (10,10) for agent a2. We do not
          care about their position in the final state."
          Please update the high-level initial and final states to reflect the changes in the 
          description for the low-level.
          Remember to prepend the low-level predicates with "ll_" to avoid conflicts with the 
          high-level predicates.s

          Sure. The initial and goal states provided in the high-level are updated as follows:
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b3),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,3,3),
            clear(b1), clear(b2), clear(b3),
            available(a1), available(a2),
            ll_arm_at(a1,0,0), ll_arm_at(a2,10,10)
          ]).
          ```
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), on(b3, b1),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,1,1),
            clear(b2), clear(b3),
            available(a1), available(a2),
            ll_arm_at(a1,_,_), ll_arm_at(a2,_,_)
          ]).
          ```
          Indeed, the only difference is the information regarding the position of the agent with
          the robotic arm at the beginning and at the end. In particular, we introduce a new
          predicate, `ll_arm_at/3`, to represent the position of the agent with the robotic arm.
          Since the description says that we do not care about the position of the arms at the end,
          we use the wildcard `_` to represent any value for the position of the arms in the goal.
