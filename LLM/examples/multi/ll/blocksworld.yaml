          Sure. The knowledge base provided in the high-level is updated as follows:
          ```kb
          % Positions on the table
          pos(1,1).

          The new knowledge base reflects the changes in the description for the low-level and 
          identifies new possible resources to be used. In particular, the new knowledge base 
          includes the arms that the agents have, which can be used to pick objects. These arms are
          also considered as resources that can be used in the task. In the description no other 
          change was made, so the knowledge base remains the same.

          Please update the high-level initial and final states to reflect the changes in the

          Sure. The initial and goal states provided in the high-level are updated as follows:

          Indeed, the only difference is the information regarding the position of the agent with
          the robotic arm at the beginning and at the end. In particular, we introduce a new
          predicate, `ll_arm_at/3`, to represent the position of the agent with the robotic arm.
          Since the description says that we do not care about the position of the arms at the end,
          we use the wildcard `_` to represent any value for the position of the arms in the goal.

            ll_arm_at(a1,0,0), ll_arm_at(a2,10,10)
          ]).
          ```
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), on(b3, b1),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,1,1),
            clear(b2), clear(b3),
            available(a1), available(a2),
            ll_arm_at(a1,_,_), ll_arm_at(a2,_,_)
          ]).
          ```
          Indeed, the only difference is the information regarding the position of the agent with
          the robotic arm at the beginning and at the end. In particular, we introduce a new
          predicate, `ll_arm_at/3`, to represent the position of the agent with the robotic arm.
          Since the description says that we do not care about the position of the arms at the end,
          we use the wildcard `_` to represent any value for the position of the arms in the goal.
