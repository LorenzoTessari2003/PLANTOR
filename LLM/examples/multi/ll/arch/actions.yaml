          Consider the following description of the low-level aspect of the same problem. Each agent has an arm and a 
          gripper and they start from position (0,0,0) for a1 and (20,20,20) for a2. Also the actual actions that the
          agents can perform are given below:
          move_arm(agent_id, xi, yi, zi, xf, yf, zf), which moves the arm of the agent identified by agent_id from the
            initial position (xi, yi, zi) to the final position (xf, yf, zf).
          open_gripper(agent_id), which opens the gripper of the agent identified by agent_id.
          close_gripper(agent_id), which closes the gripper of the agent identified by agent_id.

          Can you update the set of actions to also include actions for the low-level part?

          Sure. First of all, since we are solving a temporal plan, we need to divide the actions into start and end. We 
          will have then 6 snap actions, namely `move_arm_start`, `move_arm_end`, `open_gripper_start`,
          `open_gripper_end`, `close_gripper_start`, `close_gripper_end`. 
          `move_arm_start` has as positive precondition the position of the arm for that agent. It also requires that
            the arm is not moving, nor gripping or releasing anything. Moreover, its arguments must be grounded, so we 
            need to check that the agent chosen actually has an arm and that the final position exists. For the effects,
            we add a transitioning predicate which states that the arm is moving from the initial to the final position,
            and we remove the predicate that states that the arm is in a certain position.
          `move_arm_end` has as positive precondition the fact that the arm is moving from the initial to the final
            position. It has no negative preconditions. The effects are that the arm is no longer moving, the arm is in
            the final position.
          `open_gripper_start` it requires that the arm has something gripped and that it is not moving, nor gripping, 
            nor releasing. Also, we must make sure that in the KB the agent A actually has a gripper. The effects are
            that we remove the gripped predicate and that the gripper is close, while we state that the gripper is 
            opening.
          `open_gripper_end` has as positive precondition that the gripper is opening. It has no negative preconditions,
            but we must make sure that the agent has a gripper. The effects are that the gripper is open and that the
            gripper is no longer opening.
          `close_gripper_start` it requires that the gripper is open and that it is not moving, nor gripping, nor
            releasing, not that it has something gripped. Also, we must make sure that in the KB the agent A actually 
            has a gripper. The effects are that we remove the open gripper predicate and we must state that the 
            gripper is closing.
          `close_gripper_end` has as positive precondition that the gripper is closing. It has no negative
            preconditions, but we must make sure that the agent has a gripper. The effects are that the gripper is close
            and that the gripper is no longer closing and that it has something gripped.
