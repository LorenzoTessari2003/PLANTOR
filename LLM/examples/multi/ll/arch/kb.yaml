          Given the high-level knowledge-base obtained from the high level description:
          ```kb
          % Positions
          pos(32,60).
          pos(113,83).
          pos(44,40).
          pos(86,52).
          pos(72,52).
          pos(79,52).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          arch(b3).

          % Agents
          agent(a1).
          agent(a2).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```

          Consider the following description of the low-level aspect of the same problem. 
          
          Let the blocks be in the same position as the high-level description. 
          The agents are robotics arm equipped with a gripper. At the beginning, the end-effector of the 
          agents are in position (4,4) and (5,5) for agents a1, a2, respectively. Each agent has the following 
          APIs:
          - move_arm(Agent, x, y, z), which moves the end-effector to a position (x, y, z).
          - close_gripper(Agent), which closes the gripper.
          - open_gripper(Agent), which opens the gripper.
          Remember that, while the blocks have to be left on the table, the architrave has to be placed higher.
          Remember to use the appropriate tags for the code you produce and not to use prolog tags.

          Can you integrate the previous high-level knowledge-base with predicates needed for the low-level 
          knowledge-base?

      A:

          Sure. The description says that there are two arms and two grippers, so we have to define the predicates for
          them. Moreover, they are also both resources so they must be explicitly marked as such. Here is the final
          integration:
          ```KB
          % Positions
          pos(32,60).
          pos(113,83).
          pos(44,40).
          pos(86,52).
          pos(72,52).
          pos(79,52).
          pos(4,4).
          pos(5,5).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          arch(b3).

          % Agents
          agent(a1).
          agent(a2).

          % Low-level predicates for arms and grippers
          ll_arm(a1).
          ll_arm(a2).

          ll_gripper(a1).
          ll_gripper(a2).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          resources(ll_arm(_)).
          resources(ll_gripper(_)).
          ```
