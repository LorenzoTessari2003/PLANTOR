          Can you describe what teh actions are? 
      A:

          Sure. We are doing temporal planning, so we need actions that last in time and not 
          classical actions, which are instead described in the STRIP classical planning. A temporal 
          action is split into two snap actions: the start and the end, and it has a durative 
          condition. Both snap actions have their own preconditions and effects. The start actions
          are identified by appending `_start` to the action name, while the end actions are 
          identified by appending `_end` to the action name.

      Q:

          Can you generate a prolog code including a set of actions in order for an agent to move a 
          block that is on a position on the table to another position on the table? The action
          checks if the block at the beginning is on the table and is free to be moved, i.e., there
          are no blocks on top of it, and if there is an agent available to move the block. The 
          final part of the action can be carried out if the final position is actually free, i.e., 
          there are no blocks occupying it. When the action is completed, the block is moved to the
          final position and the agent is available again. The initial position of the block is
          freed from the moment in which the action starts.
          The predicates should be in accordance with the following knowledge-base, initial and 
          final states?
          ```kb
          % Positions
          pos(1,1).
          pos(2,2).
          pos(3,3).
          pos(4,4).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).
          block(b4).
          block(b5).

          % Agent
          agent(a1).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), 
            clear(b1), clear(b2),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1),
            on(b2,b1),
            at(b1,3,3), at(b2,3,3), 
            clear(b2),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          Sure, here is the Prolog code:
          ```actions
          % The robot starts to move the block
          action(move_block_table_to_table_start(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2), 
            [ontable(Block), at(Block, X1, Y1) available(Agent), clear(Block)],
            [moving_block_table_to_table(_, Block, _, _), moving_block_table_to_block(_, Block, _, _, _, _, _), moving_block_on_to_table(_, Block, _, _, _, _), moving_block_on_to_block(_, Block, _, _, _, _, _)],
            [ontable(Block), at(Block, X, Y)],
            [pos(X1, Y1), pos(X2, Y2), block(Block), agent(Agent)],
            [
              del(available(Agent)), del(clear(Block)), del(at(Block, X1, Y1)), del(ontable(Block)),
              add(moving_block_table_to_table(Agent, Block, _, _))
            ]
          ).                           

          % The robot finalizes moving the block to the final position on the table
          action(move_block_table_to_table_end(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
            [moving_block_table_to_table(Agent, Block, X1, Y1)],
            [at(_, X2, Y2)],
            [],
            [],
            [],
            [
              del(moving_block_table_to_table(Agent, Block, Pos1)), 
              add(available(Agent)), add(at(Block, Pos2)), add(ontable(Block)), add(clear(Block))
            ]
          ).
          ```
          The above prolog code involving start and end actions allows an agent to a block from a 
          position on the table to another position. As stated in the description, to start moving 
          the block, it must be free, i.e., not have any other block on top of it, which is 
          represented in the `init_state` by the `clear(Block)` predicate. The agent must also be
          available, which is represented by the `available(Agent)` predicate. The block must be on 
          the correct initial position in (X1, Y1), which is represented by the `at(Block, X1, Y1)`.
          The block must also be on the table, which is represented by the `ontable(Block)` 
          predicate. Moreover, the _start action make sure, in the second list, that there is not 
          another agent that is moving the same block. In the third list, it ensure that the block
          that it wants to move is not is not already in the right position for the final goal. This
          means that, let `Block=b1` and (X,Y)=(1,1), if in the `goal_state` there are the 
          predicates `ontable(b1)` and `at(b1, 1, 1)`, then the action will not be performed as the
          block is already in the right place. As the effects, the action removes the 
          `available(Agent)` predicate, the `clear(Block)` predicate, the `at(Block, X1, Y1)` 
          predicate, and the `ontable(Block)` predicate. It adds the 
          `moving_block_table_to_table(Agent, Block, _, _)` predicate, which represents that the 
          block is being moved as the durative effect between the start action and the end action.
          The end action checks that the final position is free, i.e., there is no other block 
          occupying it, which is represented by the `at(_, X2, Y2)` predicate. The end action also
          removes the `moving_block_table_to_table(Agent, Block, Pos1)` predicate, which represents
          that the block is being moved, and adds the `available(Agent)` predicate, the
          `at(Block, Pos2)` predicate, the `ontable(Block)` predicate, and the `clear(Block)`
          predicate.

    #       Can you provide the code for the actions that can be done by the agents in the blocksworld
    #       scenario?
    #       Can you generate the code for the actions that can be done by the agents in this scenario?
    #       The agents can:
    #       - move a block from a position on the table to another position on the table. The block 
    #         moved must not have another block on top. 
    #       - move a block from a position on the table to the top of another block that is on the
    #         table. Neither blocks can have another block on top.
    #       - move a block B1 from the top of a block B2 to the top of another block B3. Neither B1 
    #         nor B3 can have a block on top of them and B2 will become free after the start of the 
    #         action.
    #       - move a block from the top of another block to a position on the table. The block moved 
    #         must not have another block on top and the final position must be free.
    #       Remember that the actions are durative actions and hence must be split in start and end 
    #       actions.
