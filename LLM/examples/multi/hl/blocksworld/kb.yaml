          Can you generate a Prolog snippet of code that describes the static knowledge base for
          the following scenario? Also, highlight which are the resources of the problem, for
          example the agents, that is, those predicates that carry out tasks.
          Given an initial state in which there are four blocks b1, b2, b3, b5 on the table in 
          positions (2,2), (1,1), (3,3), (4,4), respectively, and a fifth block b4 on top of b3 in 
          position (3,3), move the block b2 on top of b1, b3 on top of b2 and place b5 on the table 
          in position (0,0) and b4 on the table in position (3,3). The agent is initially available 
          and it will also be available at the end.

      A:

          Sure. The problem states that there are 4 blocks at the beginning and 4 blocks at the end,
          so each block is static part of the knowledge base since they are not removed or added 
          during the actions. We'll use the predicate `block(Block)` to describe this. The scenario
          also describes some positions on a table, which are immutable by definition, so we'll use
          the predicate `pos(X, Y)` to describe this. Moreover, the description talks about an agent
          which carries out actions. This agent is not removed from the description of the state, so
          it is a static part of the knowledge base, and we'll use the predicate `agent(Agent)` to
          describe it. Finally, since the agent is what carries out the actions, we'll use the
          predicate `resources(agent(_))` to describe that whatever agent we consider, that is a 
          resource. 
          Here it the static knowledge base in Prolog:
          ```kb
          % Positions
          pos(1,1).
          pos(2,2).
          pos(3,3).
          pos(4,4).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).
          block(b4).
          block(b5).

          % Agent
          agent(a1).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```
          
          Notice that we do not add more blocks or positions than the ones specified in the problem
          as we do not have knowledge of them. 
          Also mind to use the term `resources(predicate)` to describe the resources of the problem, 
          and do not itemize them as single `resource(predicate)` predicates.

          Can you provide the general static knowledge base for the following scenario? 
          There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (2,2), block b2 is in position (4,4), block b4 is in position (8,8). Block b5 is 
          on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on top of block b2 in position 
          (4,4). After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on top
          of block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the 
          same positions as in the initial state. There are other blocks which are not relevant for 
          the simulation, such as b6, b7. We do not care about their position. 
          There are 8 agents with a robotic arm.

          pos(2,2).
          pos(4,4).
          pos(8,8).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).
          block(b4).

          block(b6).
          block(b7).

          agent(a2).

          agent(a5).
          agent(a6).
          agent(a7).
          agent(a8).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```

          As for the rest, I enumerated the agents available as well as the blocks that are part of
          the scenario.
          The only predicate that can be used to carry out task is `agent`, which is then added to
          the `resources` predicate to indicate that the agents are resources.
          Also mind to use the term `resources(predicate)` to describe the resources of the problem, 
          and do not itemize them as single `resource(predicate)` predicates.

          Can you provide the general knowledge base for the following scenario? 
          "There are 5 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (1,1), block b2 is in position (2,2), block b3 is in position (3,3), b4 is in
          position (4,4) and b5 is in position (5,5). After the execution of the plan, the blocks 
          are still on the table, but their positions are b1: (5,5), b2: (4,4), b3: (3,3), b4: (2,2)
          and b5: (1,1). There are two available agents that can carry out the task. They are 
          available at the beginning and will be available at the end."

          Sure, here is the description of the static knowledge base
          ```kb
          % Positions
          pos(2,2).
          pos(4,4).
          pos(8,8).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).
          block(b4).
          block(b5).

          agent(a8).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```

          I took the freedom to add some extra positions on the table in order to randomly assign
          the positions of the remaining blocks b6 and b7 later on. 
          As for the rest, I enumerated the agents available as well as the blocks that are part of
          the scenario.
          The only predicate that can be used to carry out task is `agent`, which is then added to

          Sure, the resources should be included only in the `resources` predicate, and not as
          individual `resource` predicates. Here is the corrected knowledge base:
          ```kb
          % Positions
          pos(2,2).
          pos(4,4).
          pos(8,8).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).
          block(b4).
          block(b5).
          block(b6).
          block(b7).

          % Agents
          agent(a1).
          agent(a2).
          agent(a3).
          agent(a4).
          agent(a5).
          agent(a6).
          agent(a7).
          agent(a8).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```

          To do so, we use the _ wildcard to match any agent, and then we add the `resources` 
          predicate. This way, we can describe the resources of the problem without having to
          enumerate them all.
