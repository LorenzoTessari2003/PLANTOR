          Can you generate a Prolog snippet of code that describes the initial and final states for 
          the following scenario? 
          Given an initial state in which there are two blocks b1, b2 in position (1,1) and (2,2) 
          respectively, move the block b1 to position (3,3) and place b2 on top of b1 using an 
          agent, which is initially available and it will also be available at the end.

      A:
        role : 'assistant'

          Sure. The problem states that at the beginning there are two blocks on the table: we shall 
          use the `ontable(Block)` predicate to describe this. To state the position of the blocks
          we'll use the predicate `at(Block, X, Y)`. Since both blocks do not have a block over them
          they are clear to be picked-up, so we use the predicate `clear(Block)` to describe this. 
          Finally, the agent is available at the beginning, so we'll use the predicate 
          `available(Agent)`.
          Here is the initial state:
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), 
            clear(b1), clear(b2),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          At the end, the problem states that block b2 is on top of block b1, so we'll use the
          predicate `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` to describe that `BlockTop` is on top of 
          `BlockBottom`. Notice that now only b2 will be pickable, hence we'll have the predicate
          `clear(b2)`, but not the predicate `clear(b1)`. 
          Here is the code for the goal state:
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1),
            on(b2,b1),
            at(b1,3,3), at(b2,3,3), 
            clear(b2),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          Can you generate a Prolog snippet of code that describes the initial and final states for 
          the following scenario? 
          Given an initial state in which there are two blocks b1, b2 on the table in positions 
          (1,1) and (2,2), respectively, and a third block b3 on top of b1 in position (1,1), move 
          the block b3 on top of b2 using an agent, which is initially available and it will also be 
          available at the end.

      A:
        role : 'assistant'
        content: |
          Sure. The problem states that at the beginning there are two blocks on the table: we shall 
          use the `ontable(Block)` predicate to describe this. It also says that there is a block,
          namely b3, which is on top of b1, so we'll use the predicate `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)`
          to specify that `BlockTop` is positioned above `BlockBottom`. To state the position of the
          blocks we'll use the predicate `at(Block, X, Y)`. Since both b2 and b3 do not have a block
          over them they are clear to be picked-up, so we use the predicate `clear(Block)` to 
          describe this. Finally, the agent is available at the beginning, so we'll use the 
          predicate `available(Agent)`.
          Here it the initial state in Prolog:
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), on(b3, b1),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,1,1),
            clear(b3), clear(b2),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          At the end, the problem states that block b3 is on top of block b2, so we'll have that 
          b3 is on top of b2. Notice that now b3 will still be pickable, hence we'll have the 
          predicate `clear(b3)`, but not the predicate `clear(b2)`. We'll also have that b1 is
          clear since it does not have any block on top of it anymore. 
          Here is the Prolog code for the goal state:
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), on(b3,b2),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,2,2),
            clear(b1), clear(b3),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          Can you generate a Prolog snippet of code that describes the initial and final states for 
          the following scenario? 
          Given an initial state in which there are four blocks b1, b2, b3, b5 on the table in 
          positions (2,2), (1,1), (3,3), (4,4), respectively, and a fifth block b4 on top of b3 in 
          position (3,3), move the block b2 on top of b1, b3 on top of b2 and place b5 on the table 
          in position (0,0) and b4 on the table in position (3,3). The agent is initially available 
          and it will also be available at the end.

      A:

          Sure. The problem states that at the beginning there are 4 blocks on the table: we shall 
          use the `ontable(Block)` predicate to describe this. It also says that there is a block
          on top of another block, so we'll use the predicate `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` to specify
          that `BlockTop` is positioned above `BlockBottom`. To state the position of the blocks 
          we'll use the predicate `at(Block, X, Y)`. Since there are blocks that do not have a block 
          over them they are clear to be picked-up, so we use the predicate `clear(Block)` to 
          describe this. Finally, the agent is available at the beginning, so we'll use the 
          predicate `available(Agent)`.
          Here it the initial state in Prolog:
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b3), on(b4, b3), ontable(b5),
            at(b1,2,2), at(b2,1,1), at(b3,3,3), at(b4,3,3), at(b5,4,4),
            clear(b1), clear(b2), clear(b4), clear(b5),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          At the end, the problem states that block b2 is on top of block b1 and b3 is on top of b2
          forming a pillar so we'll have two predicates `on(b2,b1)` and `on(b3,b2)`. Also, blocks
          b4 and b5 are now on the table. Notice that b3, b4 and b5 will be pickable, hence we'll 
          have the predicate `clear(Block)`, for the three blocks, but not for b1 or b2. 
          Here is the Prolog code for the goal state:
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b4), ontable(b5),
            on(b2,b1), on(b3,b2),
            at(b1,2,2), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,2,2), at(b4,3,3), at(b5,0,0),

          Can you provide the initial and final states for the following scenario? 
          There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (2,2), block b2 is in position (4,4), block b4 is in position (8,8). Block b5 is 
          on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on  top of block b2 in position 
          (4,4). After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on top
          of block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the 
          same positions as in the initial state. Other blocks, such as b6, are assigned random 
          positions on the table, which is a 10x10 grid. Please explicitly assign these positions.
          There are 8 agents with a robotic arm.

          Sure, here is the description of the initial and final states
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b4), ontable(b6), ontable(b7),
            on(b5, b1), on(b3, b2), 
            at(b1,2,2), at(b2,4,4), at(b4,8,8), at(b5,2,2), at(b3,4,4), at(b6,1,1), at(b7,3,3),
            clear(b5), clear(b3), clear(b4), clear(b6), clear(b7),
            available(a1), available(a2), available(a3), available(a4), available(a5), available(a6), available(a7), available(a8)
          ]).
          ```
          We can see that the initial state describes the positions of the blocks on the table. The
          description says that there are 7 blocks and provides the position for the first 5 blocks. 
          Their positions are then reported by using a combination of the predicates `ontable(Block)`,
          `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` and `at(Block, X, Y)`. The blocks that are not on top of
          another block are described as clear to be picked-up by the agent, hence the predicate
          `clear(Block)` is used. The agent is available at the beginning, so the predicate
          `available(Agent)` is used. Also notice that the description clearly states that the 
          position of the remaining blocks, which in this case are b6 and b7, must be assigned 
          randomly, hence we have given the blocks two positions on the table that are not used by 
          the other blocks and that do not interfere. 

          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b4), ontable(b6), ontable(b7),
            on(b5, b4), on(b3, b2),
            at(b1,2,2), at(b2,4,4), at(b3,4,4), at(b4,8,8), at(b5,8,8), at(b6,1,1), at(b7,3,3),
            clear(b1), clear(b3), clear(b5), clear(b6), clear(b7),
            available(a1), available(a2), available(a3), available(a4), available(a5), available(a6), available(a7), available(a8)
          ]).
          ```
          The final state describes the positions of the blocks on the table after the actions have
          been carried out. The description states that b5 was the only block that was moved, and
          it was placed on top of b4. The positions of the blocks that were not moved are the same
          as in the initial state and must be reported. The positions of the remaining blocks, b6
          and b7, are also reported as in the initial state since they belong to the remaining 
          blocks that were not moved. The agents are still available at the end, so the predicate
          `available(Agent)` is used.

          same positions as in the initial state. Other blocks, such as b6, are assigned random 
          positions on the table, which is a 10x10 grid. Please explicitly assign these positions.

          We can see that the initial state describes the positions of the blocks on the table. The
          description says that there are 7 blocks and provides the position for the first 5 blocks. 
          Their positions are then reported by using a combination of the predicates `ontable(Block)`,
          `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` and `at(Block, X, Y)`. The blocks that are not on top of
          another block are described as clear to be picked-up by the agent, hence the predicate
          `clear(Block)` is used. The agent is available at the beginning, so the predicate
          `available(Agent)` is used. Also notice that the description clearly states that the 
          position of the remaining blocks, which in this case are b6 and b7, must be assigned 
          randomly, hence we have given the blocks two positions on the table that are not used by 
          the other blocks and that do not interfere.

          The final state describes the positions of the blocks on the table after the actions have
          been carried out. The description states that b5 was the only block that was moved, and
          it was placed on top of b4. The positions of the blocks that were not moved are the same
          as in the initial state and must be reported. The positions of the remaining blocks, b6
          and b7, are also reported as in the initial state since they belong to the remaining 
          blocks that were not moved. The agents are still available at the end, so the predicate
          `available(Agent)` is used.

          ```
          We can see that the initial state describes the positions of the blocks on the table. The
          description says that there are 5 blocks and provides the positions of all the blocks. 
          Their positions are then reported by using a combination of the predicates `ontable(Block)`,
          and `at(Block, X, Y)`. All the blocks are on the table and not on top of other blocks. 
          For this reason, the predicate `clear(Block)` is used. The agents are available at the
          beginning, so the predicate `available(Agent)` is used.

          ```goal

          ```
          The final state describes the positions of the blocks on the table after the actions have
          been carried out. The description states that all the blocks, except b3, have been moved
          around being swapped in pairs. The agents are still available at the end, so the predicate
          `available(Agent)` is used.
