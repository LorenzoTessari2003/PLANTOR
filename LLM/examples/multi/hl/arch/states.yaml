          There are 3 blocks on the table, two boxes and one more elongated for the arch. Our goal 
          is to create an arch with these blocks by first constructing the two pillars and then 
          placing the architrave on top of them. The position available are as follows:
          - a: (1, 1, 0)
          - b: (2, 2, 0)
          - c: (3, 4, 0)
          - d: (5, 5, 0)
          - e: (9, 9, 0)
          - f: (1.5, 1.5, 0)
          Initially, the blocks are free and the agents are available. 
          Moreover, one block is in position c, another is in position d and the architrave is in 
          position e. We want to construct the first pillar on a, the second pillar on b and the 
          arch on top of them. There are two agents that can carry out this task, namely a1 and a2. 
          They are free both at the beginning and at the end of the scenario. 
          We want to construct the first pillar on a using block1, the second pillar on b using 
          block2, and the arch on top of them. 
          Also the knowledge base extracted before is the following:
          ```KB
          :- discontiguous resources/1.
          
          % blocks
          block(block1).
          block(block2).
          arch(arch1).

          % agents
          agent(a1).
          agent(a2).

          % positions
          pos(a, 1, 1, 0).
          pos(b, 2, 2, 0).
          pos(c, 3, 4, 0).
          pos(d, 5, 5, 0).
          pos(e, 9, 9, 0).
          pos(f, 1.5, 1.5, 0).

          % resources
          resource(agent(_)).
          ```
          Can you provide the initial and final states?

          Sure. The description states that at the beginning we have 3 blocks that are free and that 
          we can use. Also, it states that the agents are available and can be used. The blocks 
          are positioned in d and e, respectively, and the architrave is in position e.
          ```init
          init_state([
            av(a1), av(a2), free(block1), free(block2), free(arch1), at(c, block1), at(d, block2), 
            at(e, arch1)]).
          ```
          At the end, we have constructed a pillar on position a and a pillar on position b, so we
          use the predicate `pillar(Pos, Block)` for the two pillars. Also the architrave must be
          placed on top of that, so we use the predicate `arch(Pos1, Pos1, Arch)`, which tells us
          that there is an arch Arch going from Pos1 to Pos2. Moreover, we need to express where the
          blocks are now with the attribute `at(Block, Pos)`. Finally, at the end the agents are
          available, but the blocks are not free anymore as we have made the arch.
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            av(a1), av(a2), pillar(a, block1), pillar(b, block2), arch(a, b, arch1),
            at(a, block1), at(b, block2), at(e, arch1)
          ]).
          ```
