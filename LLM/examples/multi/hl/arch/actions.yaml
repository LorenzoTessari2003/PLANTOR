          There are 3 blocks on the table, two boxes and one more elongated for the arch. Our goal is to create an arch
          with these blocks by first constructing the two pillars and then placing the architrave on top of them. The 
          position available are as follows:
          - a: (1, 1, 0)
          - b: (2, 2, 0)
          - c: (3, 4, 0)
          - d: (5, 5, 0)
          - e: (9, 9, 0)
          - f: (1.5, 1.5, 0)
          Initially, the blocks are free and the agents are available. Moreover, one block is in position c, another is 
          in position d and the architrave is in position e.
          We want to construct the first pillar on a, the second pillar on b and the arch on top of them. 
          There are two agents that can carry out this task, namely a1 and a2. 
          Moreover, the initial and final states and the knowledge base extracted before are the following:
          ```KB
          :- discontiguous resources/1.
          
          % blocks
          block(block1).
          block(block2).
          arch(arch1).

          % agents
          agent(a1).
          agent(a2).

          % positions
          pos(a, 1, 1, 0).
          pos(b, 2, 2, 0).
          pos(c, 3, 4, 0).
          pos(d, 5, 5, 0).
          pos(e, 9, 9, 0).
          pos(f, 1.5, 1.5, 0).

          % resources
          resource(agent(_)).
          ```
          ```init
          [av(a1), av(a2), free(block1), free(block2), free(arch1), at(c, block1), at(d, block2), at(e, arch1)]
          ```
          ```goal
          [
            av(a1), av(a2), pillar(a, block1), pillar(b, block2), arch(a, b, arch1),
            at(a, block1), at(b, block2), at(e, arch1),

          ]
          ```
          Can you provide the set of actions?
      A:

          Sure. The actions that we need to perform are two: one to build the pillars and one to place the architrave.
          The first action is to build the pillars, which is divided into two steps (since we are doing temporal 
          planning): one to start building the pillar and one to end building the pillar. The precondition for the
          starting action to build the pillars are that there must be an agent available and the block must be free. 
          Also there mus not be a pillar on the position where we want to build the pillar, nor there should be another
          agent building another pillar on the same position. In order to guide the search, we set the forth argument 
          of `action` to be `pillar(Pos, Block1)` so that it will be grounded against the goal state. Moreover, there 
          are some predicates that must be ground w.r.t. the kb, in particular, the block must be a block, the agent 
          must be an agent and the position must be a valid position. The effects of the action are to remove the agent
          availability and the block freedom and to add the fact that the agent is building the pillar. 
          The ending action to build a pillar is simpler, as it only requires that the agent is building the pillar, and
          we also want to make sure that by change an agent hasn't built another pillar on the same position. The 
          effects are that we remove the predicate of building the pillar, we add the agent is available and we add the
          fact that the pillar has been built.
          The second action is to place the architrave, which is also divided into two steps. The starting action 
          requires that the agent is available, that the two pillars are built and that the architrave is free. We test
          against the final state that the positions and the arch is correct, and we ground the arch, the agent and the 
          positions to verify that they exist. Also we ensure that the two positions are different. Finally, the effects
          are that the agent is not available anymore and that the agent is placing the architrave. 
          The ending action is simpler, as it only requires that the agent is placing the architrave. We also make sure
          that there is no architrave on those same pillars. The effects are that the agent is available again and that
          the architrave has been placed.
