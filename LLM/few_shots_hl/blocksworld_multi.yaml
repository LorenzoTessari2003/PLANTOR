          Can you generate a Prolog snippet of code that describes the initial and final states for 
          the following scenario? 
          Given an initial state in which there are two blocks b1, b2 in position (1,1) and (2,2) 
          respectively, move the block b1 to position (3,3) and place b2 on top of b1 using an 
          agent, which is initially available and it will also be available at the end.

      A:
        role : 'assistant'

          Sure. The problem states that at the beginning there are two blocks on the table: we shall 
          use the `ontable(Block)` predicate to describe this. To state the position of the blocks
          we'll use the predicate `at(Block, X, Y)`. Since both blocks do not have a block over them
          they are clear to be picked-up, so we use the predicate `clear(Block)` to describe this. 
          Finally, the agent is available at the beginning, so we'll use the predicate 
          `available(Agent)`.
          Here is the initial state:
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), 
            clear(b1), clear(b2),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          At the end, the problem states that block b2 is on top of block b1, so we'll use the
          predicate `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` to describe that `BlockTop` is on top of 
          `BlockBottom`. Notice that now only b2 will be pickable, hence we'll have the predicate
          `clear(b2)`, but not the predicate `clear(b1)`. 
          Here is the code for the goal state:
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1),
            on(b2,b1),
            at(b1,3,3), at(b2,3,3), 
            clear(b2),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          Can you generate a Prolog snippet of code that describes the initial and final states for 
          the following scenario? 
          Given an initial state in which there are two blocks b1, b2 on the table in positions 
          (1,1) and (2,2), respectively, and a third block b3 on top of b1 in position (1,1), move 
          the block b3 on top of b2 using an agent, which is initially available and it will also be 
          available at the end.

      A:
        role : 'assistant'
        content: |
          Sure. The problem states that at the beginning there are two blocks on the table: we shall 
          use the `ontable(Block)` predicate to describe this. It also says that there is a block,
          namely b3, which is on top of b1, so we'll use the predicate `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)`
          to specify that `BlockTop` is positioned above `BlockBottom`. To state the position of the
          blocks we'll use the predicate `at(Block, X, Y)`. Since both b2 and b3 do not have a block
          over them they are clear to be picked-up, so we use the predicate `clear(Block)` to 
          describe this. Finally, the agent is available at the beginning, so we'll use the 
          predicate `available(Agent)`.
          Here it the initial state in Prolog:
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), on(b3, b1),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,1,1),
            clear(b3), clear(b2),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          At the end, the problem states that block b3 is on top of block b2, so we'll have that 
          b3 is on top of b2. Notice that now b3 will still be pickable, hence we'll have the 
          predicate `clear(b3)`, but not the predicate `clear(b2)`. We'll also have that b1 is
          clear since it does not have any block on top of it anymore. 
          Here is the Prolog code for the goal state:
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), on(b3,b2),
            at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,2,2),
            clear(b1), clear(b3),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          Can you generate a Prolog snippet of code that describes the initial and final states for 
          the following scenario? 
          Given an initial state in which there are four blocks b1, b2, b3, b5 on the table in 
          positions (2,2), (1,1), (3,3), (4,4), respectively, and a fifth block b4 on top of b3 in 
          position (3,3), move the block b2 on top of b1, b3 on top of b2 and place b5 on the table 
          in position (0,0) and b4 on the table in position (3,3). The agent is initially available 
          and it will also be available at the end.

      A:
        role : 'assistant'

          Sure. The problem states that at the beginning there are 4 blocks on the table: we shall 
          use the `ontable(Block)` predicate to describe this. It also says that there is a block
          on top of another block, so we'll use the predicate `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` to specify
          that `BlockTop` is positioned above `BlockBottom`. To state the position of the blocks 
          we'll use the predicate `at(Block, X, Y)`. Since there are blocks that do not have a block 
          over them they are clear to be picked-up, so we use the predicate `clear(Block)` to 
          describe this. Finally, the agent is available at the beginning, so we'll use the 
          predicate `available(Agent)`.
          Here it the initial state in Prolog:
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b3), on(b4, b3), ontable(b5),
            at(b1,2,2), at(b2,1,1), at(b3,3,3), at(b4,3,3), at(b5,4,4),
            clear(b1), clear(b2), clear(b4), clear(b5),
            available(a1)
          ]).
          ```

          At the end, the problem states that block b2 is on top of block b1 and b3 is on top of b2
          forming a pillar so we'll have two predicates `on(b2,b1)` and `on(b3,b2)`. Also, blocks
          b4 and b5 are now on the table. Notice that b3, b4 and b5 will be pickable, hence we'll 
          have the predicate `clear(Block)`, for the three blocks, but not for b1 or b2. 
          Here is the Prolog code for the goal state:
          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b4), ontable(b5),
            on(b2,b1), on(b3,b2),
            at(b1,2,2), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,2,2), at(b4,3,3), at(b5,0,0),
            clear(b3), clear(b4), clear(b5),
            available(a1)
          ]).

          Can you generate a Prolog snippet of code that describes the static knowledge base for
          the following scenario? Also, highlight which are the resources of the problem, for
          example the agents, that is, those predicates that carry out tasks.
          Given an initial state in which there are four blocks b1, b2, b3, b5 on the table in 
          positions (2,2), (1,1), (3,3), (4,4), respectively, and a fifth block b4 on top of b3 in 
          position (3,3), move the block b2 on top of b1, b3 on top of b2 and place b5 on the table 
          in position (0,0) and b4 on the table in position (3,3). The agent is initially available 
          and it will also be available at the end.

      A:
        role : 'assistant'
        content: |
          Sure. The problem states that there are 4 blocks at the beginning and 4 blocks at the end,
          so each block is static part of the knowledge base since they are not removed or added 
          during the actions. We'll use the predicate `block(Block)` to describe this. The scenario
          also describes some positions on a table, which are immutable by definition, so we'll use
          the predicate `pos(X, Y)` to describe this. Moreover, the description talks about an agent
          which carries out actions. This agent is not removed from the description of the state, so
          it is a static part of the knowledge base, and we'll use the predicate `agent(Agent)` to
          describe it. Finally, since the agent is what carries out the actions, we'll use the
          predicate `resources(agent(_))` to describe that whatever agent we consider, that is a 
          resource. 
          Here it the static knowledge base in Prolog:
          ```kb
          % Positions
          pos(1,1).
          pos(2,2).
          pos(3,3).
          pos(4,4).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).
          block(b4).
          block(b5).

          % Agent
          agent(a1).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```
          
          Notice that we do not add more blocks or positions than the ones specified in the problem
          as we do not have knowledge of them.

    #       Can you generate a prolog code including a set of actions in order for an agent to grip a block on the table at coordinate(X,Y) in accordance with the information provided?
    #   A:

    #       Sure, here is the Prolog code:
    #       ```actions
    #       % The robot starts to grip the block
    #       action(
    #       grip_ontable_start(Agent, Block), 
    #         [ontable(Block), at(Block, X, Y) available(Agent), clear(Block)],
    #         [gripped(_, Block), gripping(_, Block)],
    #         [ontable(Block), at(Block, X, Y)],
    #         [],
    #         [del(available(Agent)), add(gripping(Agent, Block))]
    #       ).                           

    #       % The robot finalize gripping the block

    #         [del(clear(Block)), del(gripping(Agent, Block)), add(gripped(Agent, Block))]
    #       ).
    #       ```
    #       The above prolog code involving start and end actions allows an agent(robot) to grip an object. 
    #       The predicate 'clear' represents that there is no other block above the given block. 
    #       In order for the agent to start performing the gripping action, the object must not be held by another agent. Therefore, it is pointed out in the 'InvalidConditions' of the 'grip_ontable_start' action that the target object(Block1) must not be in the 'gripped' or 'gripping' conditions.
    #       The predicate 'gripped' represents that the target object is already gripped by an agent.
    #       The predicate 'gripping'  represents that an agent has started to perform gripping action but not finalized it yet.               
    #       A gripping action can only be finalized when the agent has already begun gripping. Therefore, gripping(Agent1, Block1) is in the ValidConditions.
                                
    #       In InvalidConditions of the action 'grip_ontable_start', [gripped(_, Block), gripping(_, Block)] implies that the object must not have already been held or started to be held by any robot.

          Can you provide the general static knowledge base for the following scenario? 
          There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (2,2), block b2 is in position (4,4), block b4 is in position (8,8). Block b5 is 
          on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on  top of block b2 in position 
          (4,4). After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on top
          of block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the 
          same positions as in the initial state. Other blocks, such as b6, are assigned random 
          positions on the table which is a 10 by 10 grid. Please explicitly assign these positions.
          There are 8 agents with a robotic arm.

          pos(2,2).

          pos(10,10).

          % Blocks
          block(b1).
          block(b2).
          block(b3).
          block(b4).
          block(b5).

          agent(a8).

          % Resources
          resources(agent(_)).
          ```

          Since the table is said to be a 10 by 10 grid, we can safely include more positions than 
          the ones clearly stated in the problem description in order to randomly assign the
          positions of the remaining blocks b6 and b7 later on. 
          As for the rest, I enumerated the agents available as well as the blocks that are part of
          the scenario.
          The only predicate that can be used to carry out task is `agent`, which is then added to
          the `resources` predicate to indicate that the agents are resources.

          Can you provide the initial and final states for the following scenario? 
          There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in 
          position (2,2), block b2 is in position (4,4), block b4 is in position (8,8). Block b5 is 
          on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on  top of block b2 in position 
          (4,4). After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on top
          of block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the 
          same positions as in the initial state. Other blocks, such as b6, are assigned random 
          positions on the table. Please explicitly assign these positions.
          There are 8 agents with a robotic arm. 
      
      A: 
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          Sure, here is the description of the initial and final states
          ```init
          init_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b4), ontable(b6), ontable(b7),
            on(b5, b1), on(b3, b2), 
            at(b1,2,2), at(b2,4,4), at(b4,8,8), at(b5,2,2), at(b3,4,4), at(b6,1,1), at(b7,3,3),
            clear(b5), clear(b3), clear(b4), clear(b6), clear(b7),
            available(a1), available(a2), available(a3), available(a4), available(a5), available(a6), available(a7), available(a8)
          ]).
          ```
          We can see that the initial state describes the positions of the blocks on the table. The
          description says that there are 7 blocks and provides the position for the first 5 blocks. 
          Their position is then reported by using a combination of the predicates `ontable(Block)`,
          `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` and `at(Block, X, Y)`. The blocks that are not on top of
          another block are described as clear to be picked-up by the agent, hence the predicate
          `clear(Block)` is used. The agent is available at the beginning, so the predicate
          `available(Agent)` is used. Also notice that the description clearly states that the 
          position of the remaining blocks, which in this case are b6 and b7, must be assigned 
          randomly, hence we have given the blocks two positions on the table that are not used by 
          the other blocks and that do not interfere. 

          ```goal
          goal_state([
            ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b4), ontable(b6), ontable(b7),
            on(b5, b4), on(b3, b2),
            at(b1,2,2), at(b2,4,4), at(b3,4,4), at(b4,8,8), at(b5,8,8), at(b6,1,1), at(b7,3,3),
            clear(b1), clear(b3), clear(b5), clear(b6), clear(b7),
            available(a1), available(a2), available(a3), available(a4), available(a5), available(a6), available(a7), available(a8)
          ]).
          ```
          The final state describes the positions of the blocks on the table after the actions have
          been carried out. The description states that b5 was the only block that was moved, and
          it was placed on top of b4. The positions of the blocks that were not moved are the same
          as in the initial state and must be reported. The positions of the remaining blocks, b6
          and b7, are also reported as in the initial state since they belong to the remaining 
          blocks that were not moved. The agents are still available at the end, so the predicate
          `available(Agent)` is used.
