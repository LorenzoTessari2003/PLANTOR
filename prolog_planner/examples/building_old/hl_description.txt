Consider the scenario in which we have to build an arch out of some blocks using 
a robotic arm to move the blocks. In order to build an arch, first we need to
build the two pillars in two different points and then to place the architrave
on top of the two pillars.
As general knowledge, there are 3 points, namely 'a', 'b' and 'c' in which it's
possible to build the pillars. 
At the beginning there is no pillar and the robot is available, whereas at the 
end there are two pillars, the architrave as been placed and there robot is
available again.
Can you generate a Prolog code containing the set of actions required to build
an arch? Also, can you generate the initial and final states? Finally, generate
a general knowldge base in Prolog for the other predicates that should not
change during execution.
