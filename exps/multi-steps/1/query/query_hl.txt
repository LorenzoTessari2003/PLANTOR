There are 3 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in position (1,1), block b2 is in 
position (2,2), block b3 is in position (3,3). After the execution of the plan, b1 on the table in position (1,1), 
b2 is on the table in position (2,2) and b3 is on top of b1 in position (1,1).
There are two available agents that can carry out the task. They are available at the beginning and will be
