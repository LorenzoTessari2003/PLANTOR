The only APIs that are available are the ones for the robot:
- move_start(robot, locationFrom, locationTo), which makes the robot starting to move from position (x1,y1) to position (x2,y2).
- move_end(robot, locationFrom, locationTo), which completes the movement of the robot from position (x1,y1) to position (x2,y2).
