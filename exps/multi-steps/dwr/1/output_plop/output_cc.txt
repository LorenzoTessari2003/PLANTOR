HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The scenario involves two locations, two containers, a robot, and cranes in each location. The initial state and the goal state are clearly defined. The robot and cranes have specific capabilities and constraints that are logically consistent. The sequence of actions required to achieve the goal is feasible given the described capabilities and constraints of the robot and cranes. The robot can move containers between locations, and the cranes can manipulate containers within their respective locations. The goal of moving container c2 to Location2 while keeping container c1 in Location1 can be achieved through a series of coordinated actions involving the robot and the cranes.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear setup of the environment, including the initial positions of the containers, the robot, and the cranes, as well as the constraints and capabilities of each component. The goal is also clearly defined.

The low-level description aligns with the high-level description, providing specific actions that the robot and cranes can perform. These actions are consistent with the capabilities described in the high-level part. The robot can move between locations, and the cranes can manipulate containers within their respective locations.

The sequence of actions required to achieve the goal can be executed using the provided low-level actions, ensuring that the constraints (e.g., containers must be clear before being moved) are respected. The robot and cranes can coordinate their actions to move container c2 to Location2 while leaving container c1 in its original position in Location1.
