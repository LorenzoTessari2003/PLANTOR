HL: OK.

The description is consistent. The scenario involves two locations, containers, a robot, and cranes, all with clearly defined capabilities and constraints. The goal is to move container c2 to Location2 while keeping container c1 in its original position in Location1. The cranes can manipulate containers within their respective locations, and the robot can transport containers between locations, provided the containers are clear and not obstructed. The sequence of actions required to achieve the goal is feasible given the described capabilities and constraints of the robot and cranes.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear setup of the environment, including the initial positions of the containers, the capabilities of the robot and cranes, and the goal to be achieved. The low-level description aligns with the high-level description, detailing the specific actions that the robot and cranes can perform. The actions described at the low-level are sufficient to achieve the goal stated in the high-level description, as they allow for the necessary movements and manipulations of the containers. The robot and cranes have the required capabilities to move the containers as needed, and the sequence of actions can be coordinated to achieve the desired final arrangement.
