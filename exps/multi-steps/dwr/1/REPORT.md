# Report Experiment 1 

## Consistency Check

The LLM did not detect (correctly) any inconsistency in the descriptions.

## High-Level Generation

The LLM produced all the 4 parts required for the HL KB. 

The general KB seems to correctly capture all the necessary predicates and also the resources. 

The initial state correctly captures the position of the objects and agents correctly

The goal state correctly describe state wanted

The LLM generated all the actions dividing them in start and final actions. By running the HL planner
there seems to not be any error as it finds the correct solution in 0.627 s. 

The only complain is that the container has to be putted at first onto the ground in order to be loaded in the robot.

## Low-Level Generation

TBD but seems correct.
