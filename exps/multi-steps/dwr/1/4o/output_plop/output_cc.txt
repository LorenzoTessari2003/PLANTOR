HL: OK.

The description is consistent. The scenario involves two locations, two containers, a robot, and cranes in each location. The initial positions and capabilities of the robot and cranes are clearly defined. The goal is to move container c2 to Location2 while keeping container c1 in its original position in Location1. The constraints and capabilities of the robot and cranes are well-specified, making it feasible to achieve the goal through a sequence of coordinated actions. The robot can move containers between locations, and the cranes can manipulate containers within their respective locations, ensuring that the goal can be met.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear setup of the environment, including the initial positions of the containers, the capabilities of the robot and cranes, and the goal to be achieved. The low-level description provides the necessary actions that the robot and cranes can perform to manipulate the containers. The low-level actions are appropriately detailed and do not contain high-level predicates, adhering to the requirement that they must only contain predicates that start with 'll_'. The sequence of actions described in the low-level part is sufficient to achieve the goal stated in the high-level part.
