KB: Sure. Here is the updated general knowledge base to include the new low-level predicates and resources:

```kb
% Locations
location(location1).
location(location2).

% Containers
container(c1).
container(c2).

% Robot
robot(r1).

% Cranes
crane(crane1).
crane(crane2).

% Connections
connected(location1, location2).
connected(location2, location1).

% Low-level predicates for robot
ll_robot(r1).

% Low-level predicates for cranes
ll_crane(crane1).
ll_crane(crane2).

% Resources
resources(robot(_)).
resources(crane(_)).
resources(ll_robot(_)).
resources(ll_crane(_)).
```

This updated knowledge base includes the low-level predicates `ll_robot/1` and `ll_crane/1` to represent the robot and cranes, respectively. These low-level predicates are also added to the list of resources.
INIT: Sure. Here is the updated initial and final states reflecting the low-level actions and predicates:

```init
init_state([
  at(c1, location1), on_ground(c1), 
  at(c2, location1), on(c2, c1), clear(c2),
  at(r1, location1), available(r1),
  at(crane1, location1), available(crane1),
  at(crane2, location2), available(crane2),
  ll_robot_at(r1, location1),
  ll_crane_at(crane1, location1),
  ll_crane_at(crane2, location2),
  ll_gripper(crane1, open),
  ll_gripper(crane2, open)
]).
```

```goal
goal_state([
  at(c1, location1), on_ground(c1), 
  at(c2, location2), on_ground(c2), clear(c2),
  at(r1, location1), available(r1),
  at(crane1, location1), available(crane1),
  at(crane2, location2), available(crane2),
  ll_robot_at(r1, location1),
  ll_crane_at(crane1, location1),
  ll_crane_at(crane2, location2),
  ll_gripper(crane1, _),
  ll_gripper(crane2, _)
]).
```

In the initial state, we added the low-level predicates `ll_robot_at/2` and `ll_crane_at/2` to represent the positions of the robot and cranes. We also added `ll_gripper/2` to represent the state of the grippers of the cranes, which are initially open.

In the goal state, we included the same low-level predicates to ensure the positions of the robot and cranes are maintained. We used the wildcard `_` for the gripper states since we do not care about their state at the end.
ACTIONS: Sure, here is the low-level actions set based on the provided high-level actions and the refactored low-level knowledge base:

```ll_actions
% Move the robot from one location to another
ll_action(ll_move_start(Robot, LocationFrom, LocationTo),
  [ll_at(Robot, LocationFrom)],
  [ll_moving(Robot, _, _)],
  [],
  [ll_robot(Robot), location(LocationFrom), location(LocationTo), LocationFrom \= LocationTo],
  [
    del(ll_at(Robot, LocationFrom)),
    add(ll_moving(Robot, LocationFrom, LocationTo))
  ]
).
ll_action(ll_move_end(Robot, LocationFrom, LocationTo),
  [ll_moving(Robot, LocationFrom, LocationTo)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_robot(Robot)],
  [
    del(ll_moving(Robot, LocationFrom, LocationTo)),
    add(ll_at(Robot, LocationTo))
  ]
).

% Move the crane to the top of the container
ll_action(ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Container),
  [ll_at(Crane, Location), ll_at(Container, Location)],
  [ll_moving_to_c(Crane, _)],
  [],
  [ll_crane(Crane), container(Container), location(Location)],
  [
    add(ll_moving_to_c(Crane, Container))
  ]
).
ll_action(ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Container),
  [ll_moving_to_c(Crane, Container)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_crane(Crane)],
  [
    del(ll_moving_to_c(Crane, Container)),
    add(ll_at_top(Crane, Container))
  ]
).

% Close the gripper of the crane
ll_action(ll_close_start(Crane),
  [ll_gripper(Crane, open)],
  [ll_closing(Crane)],
  [],
  [ll_crane(Crane)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Crane, open)),
    add(ll_closing(Crane))
  ]
).
ll_action(ll_close_end(Crane),
  [ll_closing(Crane)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_crane(Crane)],
  [
    del(ll_closing(Crane)),
    add(ll_gripper(Crane, closed))
  ]
).

% Open the gripper of the crane
ll_action(ll_open_start(Crane),
  [ll_gripper(Crane, closed)],
  [ll_opening(Crane)],
  [],
  [ll_crane(Crane)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Crane, closed)),
    add(ll_opening(Crane))
  ]
).
ll_action(ll_open_end(Crane),
  [ll_opening(Crane)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_crane(Crane)],
  [
    del(ll_opening(Crane)),
    add(ll_gripper(Crane, open))
  ]
).
```

This set of low-level actions corresponds to the high-level actions described in the provided knowledge base. Each low-level action is prefixed with `ll_` to avoid conflicts with high-level predicates. The low-level actions include moving the robot, moving the crane to the top of a container, and opening and closing the crane's gripper.
MAPPINGS: Sure. Here are the mappings from high-level actions to low-level actions:

```mappings
% Move a container from the ground to the top of another container within the same location using a crane
mapping(move_ground_to_top_start(Crane, Container1, Container2, Location),
  [
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Container1),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Container1),
    ll_close_start(Crane),
    ll_close_end(Crane),
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Container2),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Container2),
    ll_open_start(Crane),
    ll_open_end(Crane)
  ]
).

% Load a container onto the robot using a crane
mapping(load_container_start(Crane, Robot, Container, Location),
  [
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Container),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Container),
    ll_close_start(Crane),
    ll_close_end(Crane),
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Robot),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Robot),

  ]

  ]
).

% Move a container from the ground to another position on the ground within the same location using a crane
mapping(move_ground_to_ground_start(Crane, Container, Location1, Location2),
  [
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Container),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Container),
    ll_close_start(Crane),
    ll_close_end(Crane),
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Location2),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Location2),
    ll_open_start(Crane),
    ll_open_end(Crane)
  ]
).

% Move a container from the top of another container to the ground within the same location using a crane
mapping(move_top_to_ground_start(Crane, Container1, Container2, Location),
  [
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Container1),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Container1),
    ll_close_start(Crane),
    ll_close_end(Crane),
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Location),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Location),
    ll_open_start(Crane),
    ll_open_end(Crane)
  ]
).

% Move a container from the top of another container to the top of a different container within the same location using a crane
mapping(move_top_to_top_start(Crane, Container1, Container2, Container3, Location),
  [
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Container1),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Container1),
    ll_close_start(Crane),
    ll_close_end(Crane),
    ll_go_to_c_start(Crane, Container3),
    ll_go_to_c_end(Crane, Container3),
    ll_open_start(Crane),
    ll_open_end(Crane)
  ]
).

% Move the robot from one location to another
mapping(move_robot_start(Robot, Location1, Location2),
  [
    ll_move_start(Robot, Location1, Location2),
    ll_move_end(Robot, Location1, Location2)
  ]
).
```

These mappings ensure that each high-level action is broken down into the appropriate sequence of low-level actions.
