The scenario consists of three locations: LocationA, LocationB, and LocationC, which are directly
connected, allowing movement between them. There are seven containers initially distributed across
these locations. In LocationA, container c1 is on the ground with c2 placed on top of it, followed
by c3 on top of c2. In LocationB, container c4 is positioned on the ground with c5 stacked on top.
In LocationC, container c6 is on the ground with c7 placed on top of it. A container is not clear if
another container is stacked on top of it.   

A robot, r1, starts in LocationA and can transport containers between locations under specific
conditions. It must carry a container on top of itself, can only transport one at a time, and cannot
move if the container it is carrying is obstructed by another.   

Each location has a dedicated crane that operates exclusively within its respective area. These
cranes can stack a clear container on another within the same location, load or unload a clear
container from the robot, and place a clear container on the ground. However, they cannot transfer
containers between locations. Cranes are independent and not considered as resources, meaning each
can only execute one operation at a time and remains occupied until the action is complete.   

The objective is to rearrange the containers so that c3 is placed on top of c7 in LocationC, c5 is
moved to LocationA and placed on the ground, and c6 is transferred to LocationB and placed on top of
c4, while c1, c2, and c7 remain in their original locations. 

Achieving this configuration requires a well-coordinated sequence of actions involving both the
robot and the cranes.
