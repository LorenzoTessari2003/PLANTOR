HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state specifies the positions of the 20 blocks on the table, and the final state specifies the desired configuration of blocks b1, b2, and b3. The agents have the necessary capabilities to move blocks between positions on the table and to stack blocks on top of each other. The presence of three agents ensures that the task can be completed efficiently. The description of the agents' capabilities covers all the necessary actions to achieve the final configuration.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear initial and final state for the blocks, and the actions that the agents can perform are well-defined. The low-level description specifies the initial positions of the agents and the actions they can perform, which are consistent with the high-level actions. The agents are robotic arms capable of moving blocks, and their initial positions are given, while their final positions are not relevant. The actions at the low level (moving the arm, closing and opening the gripper) are consistent with the high-level actions of moving blocks.
