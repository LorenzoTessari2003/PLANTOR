HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state describes the position of the 20 blocks on the table, each in a unique position. The final state requires moving blocks b1, b2, and b3 to form a stack in position (4,4). The three agents available can perform the necessary actions to achieve this configuration, as they can move blocks between positions on the table and stack them on top of each other. The availability of three agents ensures that the task can be completed efficiently.
LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.

The description contains an inconsistency. The high-level description states that there are three agents available to move the blocks, but the low-level description only provides initial positions for two agents. This discrepancy means that the scenario cannot be executed as described because the number of agents does not match between the high-level and low-level descriptions. 

To make the scenario feasible, the low-level description should include the initial position of the third agent.
