There are 20 blocks on a table, named in the form b# where # is a number from 1 to 20. Each block is in 
position (x, 1), where x is a number from 1 to 20. The blocks are ordered from left to right in increasing
order of x. There are three agents that have to move the blocks from the initial configuration, i.e.,
all blocks on the table, to a final configuration in which b1 is on the table in position (4,4), b2 
is on top of b1 and b3 is on top of b2. Each agent is available at the beginning and will be available at the end. Moreover, they can:
- Move a block from a position on the table to another position in the table
- Move a block that is on the table to the top of another block
- Move a block on top of a block to another position on the table
- Move a block on top of a block to the top of another block
