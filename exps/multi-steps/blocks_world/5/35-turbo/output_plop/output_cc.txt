LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.
The description is inconsistent. The initial configuration states that all blocks are in position (x, 1), where x is a number from 1 to 20. However, the final configuration states that b1 is on the table in position (4,4), b2 is on top of b1, and b3 is on top of b2. This means that the blocks are not in the same positions as the initial configuration, which contradicts the given scenario.
