HL: OK.
The scenario described is feasible. The agent has the capability to perform all the necessary actions to achieve the goal. The agent can first move the block from position (1,1) to position (5,5). Then, it can move the block from position (2,3) to the top of the block in position (5,5). Finally, the agent can move the block from position (3,4) to the top of the stack at position (5,5). There is no indication of any constraints that would prevent these actions from being carried out sequentially by the single agent.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The high-level description of the scenario is consistent with the low-level description. The high-level actions that the agent can perform are well represented by the low-level actions `move_arm`, `close`, and `open`. The agent, a robotic arm, has the capability to move blocks around, both on the table and from one block to another, which aligns with the goals of the scenario. The initial and final positions of the arm are not an issue since the arm's starting position is given and its end position is not important. The tasks described can be accomplished sequentially by the single agent with the given capabilities.
