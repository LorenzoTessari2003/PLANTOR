% Define positions on the table

pos(3,4).

% Define blocks

block(b2).
block(b3).

% Define the agent
agent(a1).

% Define the robotic arm as a low-level concept
ll_arm(a1).

% Define resources
resources(agent(_)).
resources(ll_arm(_)).
```

This updated knowledge base includes the low-level predicates for the robotic arm (`ll_arm`) and marks it as a resource (`resources(ll_arm(_))`). The `ll_` prefix is used to distinguish low-level predicates from high-level predicates and to avoid conflicts.
INIT: Given the requirements, the initial and final states need to be updated to include the position of the robotic arm and the state of its gripper. Here's the updated initial and final states:

```init
init_state([
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b3),
  at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,3), at(b3,3,4),
  clear(b1), clear(b2), clear(b3),
  available(a1),
  ll_arm_at(a1,10,10),
  ll_gripper(a1,open)
]).
```

```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(b1), on(b2,b1), on(b3,b2),
  at(b1,5,5), at(b2,5,5), at(b3,5,5),
  clear(b3),
  available(a1),
  ll_arm_at(a1,_,_),
  ll_gripper(a1,_)
]).
```

In the initial state, the robotic arm (`a1`) is at position (10,10) and its gripper is open. In the goal state, we do not care about the final position of the arm or the state of the gripper, so we use the wildcard `_` to represent any value for these predicates.
ACTIONS: Certainly. Here is the set of low-level actions based on the given description:

```ll_actions
% Low-level action to move the robotic arm from one position to another
ll_action(ll_move_arm(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2),
  [ll_arm_at(arm, x1, y1)],
  [ll_moving_arm(arm, _, _, _, _)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(arm), pos(x2, y2)],
  [
    del(ll_arm_at(arm, x1, y1)),
    add(ll_moving_arm(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2))
  ]
).

ll_action(ll_move_arm_end(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2),
  [ll_moving_arm(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(arm), pos(x2, y2)],
  [
    del(ll_moving_arm(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2)),
    add(ll_arm_at(arm, x2, y2))
  ]
).

% Low-level action to close the gripper of the robotic arm
ll_action(ll_close_gripper(arm),
  [ll_gripper(arm, open)],
  [ll_gripping(arm, _), ll_releasing(arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(arm, open)),
    add(ll_gripper(arm, close)),
    add(ll_gripping(arm))
  ]
).

% Low-level action to open the gripper of the robotic arm
ll_action(ll_open_gripper(arm),
  [ll_gripper(arm, close)],
  [ll_gripping(arm), ll_releasing(arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(arm, close)),
    add(ll_gripper(arm, open)),
    add(ll_releasing(arm))
  ]
).
```

In this set of low-level actions, we have defined actions for moving the arm, closing the gripper, and opening the gripper. The predicates `ll_arm_at/3`, `ll_moving_arm/5`, `ll_gripper/2`, `ll_gripping/1`, and `ll_releasing/1` are used to represent the state of the robotic arm and its gripper. The `ll_` prefix is used to distinguish these low-level predicates from any high-level predicates that might exist with similar names.
MAPPINGS: Given the high-level actions and the low-level actions provided, here are the mappings from high-level actions to low-level actions:

```mappings
mapping(move_block_start(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    ll_move_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    ll_close_gripper(Agent),
    ll_open_gripper(Agent)
  ]
).

mapping(move_block_to_top_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    ll_move_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    ll_close_gripper(Agent),
    ll_open_gripper(Agent)
  ]
).

mapping(move_top_block_to_table_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    ll_move_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    ll_close_gripper(Agent),
    ll_open_gripper(Agent)
  ]
).

mapping(move_top_block_to_top_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, Block3, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    ll_move_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    ll_close_gripper(Agent),
    ll_open_gripper(Agent)
  ]
).
```

These mappings define which low-level actions should be initiated when a high-level action starts. Each high-level action that involves moving a block is mapped to a sequence of low-level actions that move the arm to the correct position, close the gripper to pick up the block, and then open the gripper to release the block. The actual movement of the block is abstracted away in the high-level action and is assumed to be part of the low-level `ll_move_arm` action. The `ll_close_gripper` and `ll_open_gripper` actions are used to simulate the gripping and releasing of the block by the robotic arm.
