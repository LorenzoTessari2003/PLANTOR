# Report Experiment BW - 4 128K - 4

## Consistency Check

The LLM correctly identified that the queries are consistent. 

## High-Level KB Generation

The LLM generate the four parts of the KB correctly. The initial and final states were generated
correctly, as well as the general KB. 

The actions though had problems:

- The predicate `pos(X,Y)` is inserted between the state preconditions, but it actually belongs to
  the general KB.
- Other minor corrections

## Low-Level KB Generation

While the LLM generated correctly the four parts of the KB, they were flawed and need much reformat.
