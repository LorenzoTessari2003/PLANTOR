# Report Experiment 3 

## Consistency Check

The LLM did not detect (correctly) any inconsistency in the descriptions.

## High-Level Generation

The LLM produced all the 4 parts required for the HL KB. 

The general KB seems to correctly capture all the necessary predicates and also the resources. 

The initial state correctly captures the position of the blocks on the table and the fact that both
agents are available.

The goal state correctly describe the movement of the block from the table to the top of another 
block.

The LLM generated all the actions dividing them in start and final actions. By running the HL planner
there seems to not be any error as it finds the correct solution in 8ms. Is worth to mention that the plan is not optimal.  

## Low-Level Generation

Could not apply mappings (16 depth)
