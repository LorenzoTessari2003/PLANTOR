HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state provides the positions of the three blocks. The goal is to stack the blocks in a specific order at a specific position. The agent has the necessary capabilities to perform the required operations: moving blocks from one position to another, and stacking blocks on top of each other. The presence of only one agent does not pose a problem, as the agent can sequentially perform the required actions to achieve the goal.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is feasible. The high-level description provides a clear goal and the actions 
that the agent can perform are sufficient to achieve the goal. The low-level description 
provides the necessary actions for the robotic arm to move and manipulate the blocks. The 
initial position of the arm is given, and it is stated that the final position of the arm 
does not matter, which is consistent with the high-level description. The actions at the 
low-level (move_arm, close, open) are sufficient to perform the high-level actions 
described.
