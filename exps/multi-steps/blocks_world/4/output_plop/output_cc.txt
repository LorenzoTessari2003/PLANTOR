HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state describes a stack of blocks A, B, C, and D in position (1,1). The final state describes the blocks rearranged such that A remains in position (1,1), B is moved to position (2,1) with C on top of B, and D is moved on top of A. The two agents with robotic arms can perform the necessary actions to achieve this rearrangement by moving blocks from one position to another and stacking them as described.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear initial and final 
state for the blocks, and the actions that the agents can perform are consistent with the 
required rearrangements. The low-level description specifies the actions that the robotic 
arms can perform, which align with the high-level actions. The initial positions of the 
arms are given, and it is stated that their final positions do not matter, which is 
acceptable. The robotic arms can move, grip, and release blocks, which are the necessary 
actions to achieve the described rearrangement of the blocks.
