INIT: Sure. Here is the updated initial and final states reflecting the changes in the description for the low-level part:

```init
init_state([
  ontable(a), on(b, a), on(c, b), on(d, c),
  at(a, 1, 1), at(b, 1, 1), at(c, 1, 1), at(d, 1, 1),
  clear(d),
  available(a1), available(a2),
  ll_arm_at(a1, 0, 0), ll_arm_at(a2, 3, 3),
  ll_gripper(a1, open), ll_gripper(a2, open)
]).
```

```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(a), ontable(b), on(c, b), on(d, a),
  at(a, 1, 1), at(b, 2, 1), at(c, 2, 1), at(d, 1, 1),
  clear(d), clear(c),
  available(a1), available(a2),
  ll_arm_at(a1, _, _), ll_arm_at(a2, _, _),
  ll_gripper(a1, _), ll_gripper(a2, _)
]).
```

In the initial state, we have added the positions of the robotic arms using the `ll_arm_at/3` predicate and the state of the grippers using the `ll_gripper/2` predicate. In the goal state, we have used the wildcard `_` to indicate that we do not care about the final positions of the arms and the state of the grippers.
ACTIONS: Sure, here is the low-level actions set based on the provided description:

```ll_actions
% Move arm start
ll_action(move_arm_start(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [ll_arm_at(Arm, X1, Y1)],
  [moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _), gripping(Arm, _), releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm), pos(X1, Y1), pos(X2, Y2)],
  [
    add(moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    del(ll_arm_at(Arm, X1, Y1))
  ]
).

% Move arm end
ll_action(move_arm_end(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    add(ll_arm_at(Arm, X2, Y2))
  ]
).

% Close gripper start
ll_action(close_start(Arm),
  [ll_gripper(Arm, open)],
  [moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _), gripping(Arm, _), releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Arm, open)),
    add(gripping(Arm, _))
  ]
).

% Close gripper end
ll_action(close_end(Arm),
  [gripping(Arm, _)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(gripping(Arm, _)),
    add(ll_gripper(Arm, closed))
  ]
).

% Open gripper start
ll_action(open_start(Arm),
  [ll_gripper(Arm, closed)],
  [moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _), gripping(Arm, _), releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Arm, closed)),
    add(releasing(Arm))
  ]
).

% Open gripper end
ll_action(open_end(Arm),
  [releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(releasing(Arm)),
    add(ll_gripper(Arm, open))
  ]
).
```

This set of low-level actions includes the necessary actions for moving the arm, and opening and closing the gripper. Each action is divided into a start and end phase to reflect the durative nature of the actions. The preconditions and effects are specified to ensure the correct sequence of actions.
MAPPINGS: Sure. Here are the mappings from high-level actions to low-level actions:

```mappings
% Mapping for move_table_to_table_start
mapping(move_table_to_table_start(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent),
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent),
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).

% Mapping for move_table_to_block_start
mapping(move_table_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent),
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent),
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).

% Mapping for move_onblock_to_table_start
mapping(move_onblock_to_table_start(Agent, Block1, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent),
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent),
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).

% Mapping for move_onblock_to_block_start
mapping(move_onblock_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent),
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent),
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).
```

These mappings reflect the sequence of low-level actions required to achieve the high-level actions. Each high-level action is mapped to a series of low-level actions that involve moving the arm to the block, closing the gripper to pick up the block, moving the arm to the target position, and opening the gripper to release the block.
