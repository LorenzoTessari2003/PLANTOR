INIT: Sure. Here is the updated initial and final states reflecting the changes in the description for the low-level part:

```init
init_state([
  ontable(a),
  on(b, a),
  on(c, b),
  on(d, c),
  at(a, 1, 1),
  at(b, 1, 1),
  at(c, 1, 1),
  at(d, 1, 1),
  clear(d),
  available(a1),
  available(a2),
  ll_arm_at(a1, 0, 0),
  ll_arm_at(a2, 3, 3),
  ll_gripper(a1, open),
  ll_gripper(a2, open)
]).
```

```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(a),
  ontable(b),
  on(c, b),
  on(d, a),
  at(a, 1, 1),
  at(b, 2, 1),
  at(c, 2, 1),
  at(d, 1, 1),
  clear(c),
  clear(d),
  available(a1),
  available(a2),
  ll_arm_at(a1, _, _),
  ll_arm_at(a2, _, _),
  ll_gripper(a1, _),
  ll_gripper(a2, _)
]).
```

In the initial state, we have added the positions of the robotic arms and the state of the grippers. In the goal state, we have used wildcards `_` to indicate that we do not care about the final positions of the arms and the state of the grippers.
ACTIONS: Sure, here is the low-level actions set based on the provided description:

```ll_actions
% Move arm start
ll_action(move_arm_start(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [ll_arm_at(Arm, X1, Y1)],
  [ll_moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _), ll_gripping(Arm, _), ll_releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm), pos(X1, Y1), pos(X2, Y2)],
  [
    add(ll_moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    del(ll_arm_at(Arm, X1, Y1))
  ]
).

% Move arm end
ll_action(move_arm_end(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [ll_moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    add(ll_arm_at(Arm, X2, Y2))
  ]
).

% Close gripper start
ll_action(close_start(Arm),
  [ll_gripper(Arm, open)],
  [ll_moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _), ll_gripping(Arm, _), ll_releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Arm, open)),
    add(ll_gripping(Arm, closing))
  ]
).

% Close gripper end
ll_action(close_end(Arm),
  [ll_gripping(Arm, closing)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripping(Arm, closing)),
    add(ll_gripper(Arm, closed))
  ]
).

% Open gripper start
ll_action(open_start(Arm),
  [ll_gripper(Arm, closed)],
  [ll_moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _), ll_gripping(Arm, _), ll_releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Arm, closed)),
    add(ll_gripping(Arm, opening))
  ]
).

% Open gripper end
ll_action(open_end(Arm),
  [ll_gripping(Arm, opening)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripping(Arm, opening)),
    add(ll_gripper(Arm, open))
  ]
).
```

This set of low-level actions includes the necessary actions for moving the robotic arm and controlling the gripper. Each action is defined with its preconditions, effects, and the conditions that must be met for the action to be executed. The low-level predicates are prefixed with `ll_` to avoid conflicts with the high-level predicates.
MAPPINGS: Sure. Here are the mappings from high-level actions to low-level actions:

```mappings
% Mapping for move_table_to_table_start
mapping(move_table_to_table_start(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1), % Move arm to the block's initial position
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent), % Close the gripper to pick up the block
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2), % Move arm to the block's final position
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent), % Open the gripper to release the block
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).

% Mapping for move_table_to_block_start
mapping(move_table_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1), % Move arm to the block1's initial position
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent), % Close the gripper to pick up block1
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2), % Move arm to the block2's position
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent), % Open the gripper to place block1 on block2
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).

% Mapping for move_onblock_to_table_start
mapping(move_onblock_to_table_start(Agent, Block1, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1), % Move arm to the block1's initial position
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent), % Close the gripper to pick up block1
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2), % Move arm to the block1's final position
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent), % Open the gripper to release block1
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).

% Mapping for move_onblock_to_block_start
mapping(move_onblock_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1), % Move arm to the block1's initial position
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent), % Close the gripper to pick up block1
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2), % Move arm to the block2's position
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent), % Open the gripper to place block1 on block2
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).
```

These mappings ensure that each high-level action is broken down into the appropriate sequence of low-level actions, reflecting the necessary steps to move the blocks as described.
