Let the blocks be in the same position as the high-level description.
There is 1 available agent that can carry out the task. It is available at the beginning and will be available at the end. The agent is actually a robotic arm that can pick up blocks and move them around. At the beginning, the arm is in position (5,5), while we do not care where it is at the end. The low_level actions that it can perform are:
move_arm_start(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2), which makes the robotic arm starting to move from position (x1,y1) to position (x2,y2).
move_arm_end(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2), which completes the movement of the robotic arm from position (x1,y1) to position (x2,y2).
grip_start(arm), which makes the gripper starting to close.
grip_end(arm), which indicates the gripper has closed.
release_start(arm), which makes the gripper starting to open.
release_end(arm), which indicates the gripper has opened.
Remember to use the appropriate tags ``` ``` for the code you produce.
