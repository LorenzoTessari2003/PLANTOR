KB: The updated general knowledge base, including the new low-level predicates and resources, is as follows:

```kb
% Positions
pos(1,1).
pos(2,3).
pos(3,4).
pos(5,5).

% Blocks
block(b1).
block(b2).
block(b3).

% Agents
agent(a1).

% Low-level predicates
ll_arm(a1).

% Resources
resources(agent(_)).
resources(ll_arm(_)).
```

The low-level predicates `ll_arm/1` is added to represent the robotic arm. The `resources/1` predicate is also updated to include the `ll_arm(_)` resource. This ensures that the planner can assign the robotic arm as a resource to perform actions.
INIT: The updated initial and goal states are as follows:

```init
init_state([
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b3),
  at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,3), at(b3,3,4),
  clear(b1), clear(b2), clear(b3),
  available(a1),
  ll_arm_at(a1,10,10),
  ll_gripper(a1,open)
]).
```

```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b3),
  on(b2, b1), on(b3, b2),
  at(b1,5,5), at(b2,5,5), at(b3,5,5),
  clear(b1), clear(b2), clear(b3),
  available(a1),
  ll_arm_at(a1,_,_),
  ll_gripper(a1,_)
]).
```

In the initial state, we include the predicates that describe the blocks and their positions, as well as the availability of the agent. We also add the low-level predicates `ll_arm_at(a1,10,10)` and `ll_gripper(a1,open)` to specify the initial position of the robotic arm and the state of its gripper.

In the goal state, we include the predicates that describe the blocks and their positions, the block stacking relationships, the availability of the agent, and the low-level predicates `ll_arm_at(a1,_,_)` and `ll_gripper(a1,_)` to indicate that we do not care about the final position of the robotic arm and the state of its gripper.
ACTIONS: ```ll_actions
ll_action(move_arm_start(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [ll_arm_at(Arm, X1, Y1)],
  [moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _, _, _), gripping(Arm, _), releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm), pos(X1, Y1), pos(X2, Y2)],
  [
    add(moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2))
  ]
).

ll_action(move_arm_end(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2))
  ]
).

ll_action(close(Arm),
  [ll_gripper(Arm, open)],
  [moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _, _, _), gripping(Arm, _), releasing(Arm), gripped(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Arm, open)),
    add(gripping(Arm, _))
  ]
).

ll_action(open(Arm),
  [gripping(Arm, _)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(gripping(Arm, _)),
    add(gripped(Arm)),
    add(ll_gripper(Arm, open))
  ]
).
```

The low-level actions set includes the following actions:
- `move_arm_start/5`: Represents the start of moving the robotic arm from one position to another. It checks if the arm is at the initial position and if it is not performing any other action. It also verifies the positions of the arm and the availability of the arm. The effects include adding the `moving_arm/6` predicate to represent the ongoing movement of the arm.
- `move_arm_end/5`: Represents the end of moving the robotic arm. It checks if the arm is in the process of moving. The effects include removing the `moving_arm/6` predicate.
- `close/1`: Represents the action of closing the gripper of the arm. It checks if the gripper is open and if the arm is not performing any other action. The effects include adding the `gripping/2` predicate to represent the gripped state of the arm.
- `open/1`: Represents the action of opening the gripper of the arm. It checks if the arm is gripping an object. The effects include removing the `gripping/2` predicate and adding the `gripped/1` predicate to represent the gripped state of the arm.

These low-level actions can be used to perform the required actions in the low-level planning.
MAPPINGS: The mappings from high-level actions to low-level actions are as follows:
```mappings
mapping(move_table_to_table_start(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
  ]
).

mapping(move_table_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
  ]
).

mapping(move_block_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
  ]
).

mapping(move_block_to_table_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
  ]
).
```
The mappings are defined for the start actions of the high-level actions. Each high-level action is mapped to the corresponding `move_arm_start` and `move_arm_end` low-level actions. The `move_arm_start` action is responsible for moving the arm from one position to another, and the `move_arm_end` action is responsible for ending the movement of the arm. The `move_arm_start` and `move_arm_end` actions are common to all high-level actions, as they are the basic actions that allow the arm to move.
