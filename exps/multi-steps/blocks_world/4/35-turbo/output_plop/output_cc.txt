HL: OK. The scenario is feasible. The description provides the initial positions of the blocks and the goal state. It also specifies the capabilities of the agent, which include moving blocks on the table, moving a block on top of another block, and moving a block on top of a block to another position on the table. The agent is available at the beginning and will be available at the end, allowing it to perform the necessary actions to achieve the goal state.
LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM. 
The high-level and low-level descriptions are inconsistent. 

In the high-level description, the goal is to put the first block in position (5,5), put the second block on top of the first, and the third block on top of the second. However, in the low-level description, there is no action that allows moving a block to a specific position on the table. The only available action is to move the arm from one position to another. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve the desired goal with the given low-level actions.

Additionally, in the low-level description, it is stated that there is only one available agent, but in the high-level description, it is mentioned that there are three blocks on the table. This discrepancy suggests an inconsistency between the two descriptions.

Overall, the high-level and low-level descriptions do not align, making the scenario infeasible.
