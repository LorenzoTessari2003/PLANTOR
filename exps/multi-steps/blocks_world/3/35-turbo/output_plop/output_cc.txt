LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.
The description is inconsistent. In the initial state, block B is on top of block A, C is on top of B, and D is on top of C. However, in the final state, block D is on top of block A. This violates the constraint that blocks can only be moved to the top of another block, not directly to the table. Therefore, the final state is not achievable based on the given actions.
