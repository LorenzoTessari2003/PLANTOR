There are 3 blocks. In the initial state of the simulation, block b3 is on top of b2, and b2 is on top of b1, with b1 on the table in position (1,1). After the execution of the plan, b1 is on the table in position (1,1), b2 is on the table in position (2,2), and b3 is on the table in position (3,3). There are two available agents that can carry out the task. They are available at the beginning and will be available at the end.
Each agent can move a block:
from the top of a block, to a position on the table.
