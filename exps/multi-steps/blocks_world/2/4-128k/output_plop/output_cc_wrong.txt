LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.

The description contains an inconsistency regarding the final position of block b4. It states that after the execution of the plan, block b4 is "not on the table in position (10,10)." This seems to be a typographical error or a contradiction because it implies that b4 is both not on the table and at a specific position on the table at the same time. If the intention was to say that b4 has been moved to position (10,10) on the table, then the scenario would be feasible, but as written, it is not clear and thus inconsistent. 

The rest of the scenario seems feasible with two agents available to move the blocks as described, and the other blocks remaining in their initial positions. However, the issue with the description of block b4's final position needs to be resolved for the scenario to be considered consistent.
