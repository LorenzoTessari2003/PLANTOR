There are 6 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in position
(1,1) on the table, block b2 is in position (2,2) on the table, block b3 is in position (3,3) on the
table, whereas blocks b4, b5 and b6 are on top of blocks b1, b2 and b3, respectively. After the 
execution of the plan, only blocks b4 and b5 have been moved. In particular, b4 is not on the table 
in position (10,10) and block b5 has been moved on top of it. There are two available agents that 
can carry out the task. They are available at the beginning and will be available at the end. 
Each agent can move a block:
- from a position on the table to another position on the table;
- from a position on the table, to the top of another block;
- from the top of a block, to a position on the table;
- from the top of a block, to the top of another block.
