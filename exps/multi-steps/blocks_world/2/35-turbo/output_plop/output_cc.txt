LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.
The description is inconsistent. The initial state states that blocks b4, b5, and b6 are on top of blocks b1, b2, and b3 respectively. However, in the final state, only blocks b4 and b5 have been moved, with b4 being on the table in position (10,10) and block b5 on top of it. This means that block b6 is missing from the final state, which contradicts the initial state.
