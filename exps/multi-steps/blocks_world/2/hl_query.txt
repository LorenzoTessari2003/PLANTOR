There are 2 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in position (1,1), block b2 is in position (2,2). After the execution of the plan, b1 is on the table in position (1,1) and b2 is on top of b1 in position (1,1). There is one available agent that can carry out the task. It is available at the beginning and will be available at the end.
Each agent can move a block:
from a position on the table to the top of another block.
