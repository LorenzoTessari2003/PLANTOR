HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state describes the positions of the blocks, with blocks b4, b5, and b6 on top of blocks b1, b2, and b3, respectively. The final state describes that only blocks b4 and b5 have been moved, with b4 now on the table in position (10,10) and b5 on top of b4. The two available agents can perform the necessary actions to achieve this final state, as they can move blocks between positions on the table and on top of other blocks.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description specifies the initial and final positions of the blocks and the actions that the agents can perform. The low-level description provides the necessary details about the agents and their capabilities, which align with the high-level actions. The agents are robotic arms equipped with grippers, and the provided APIs (move_arm, close_gripper, open_gripper) are sufficient to perform the required actions. The initial positions of the agents are also given, and it is stated that their final positions do not matter. Therefore, the scenario is feasible.
