LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.
The description is inconsistent. The final state mentions that block b4 is "not on the table in position (10,10)" and that block b5 has been moved on top of it. However, the position (10,10) is not specified as a valid position on the table in the initial state. Additionally, the description of the agents' capabilities does not include the ability to move blocks to a position that is not on the table. Therefore, the final state described is not achievable with the given constraints.
