HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state describes the positions of the blocks, with blocks b4, b5, and b6 on top of blocks b1, b2, and b3, respectively. The final state specifies that only blocks b4 and b5 have been moved, with b4 now on the table at position (10,10) and b5 on top of b4. The two available agents can perform the necessary actions to achieve this final state, as they can move blocks from the top of other blocks to positions on the table and vice versa. The description of the agents' capabilities aligns with the required actions to achieve the final state.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear initial and final state for the blocks, and the actions that the agents can perform are well-defined. The low-level description specifies the initial positions of the agents and the APIs they can use to perform the required actions. The agents are robotic arms equipped with grippers, which are capable of moving blocks as described in the high-level actions. The initial and final states of the blocks are achievable with the given actions and the available agents.
