# Report Experiment 1 

## Consistency Check

The LLM did not detect (correctly) any inconsistency in the descriptions.

## High-Level Generation

The LLM produced all the 4 parts required for the HL KB. 

The general KB seems to correctly capture all the necessary predicates and also the resources. 

The initial state correctly captures the position of the blocks on the table and the fact that both
agents are available.

The goal state correctly describe the movement of the block from the table to the top of another 
block.

The LLM generated all the actions dividing them in start and final actions. By running the HL planner
there seems to not be any error as it finds the correct solution in 8ms. Also when changing the 
order of the actions, we are still obtaining the correct result. 


## Low-Level Generation

The LLM updated the HL KB correctly, capturing the new predicates for the arm and the gripper. It 
was also able to correctly write the actions and the mappings. 

After testing with the planner, we were able to extract a plan in 9ms.
