HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state specifies the positions of the blocks, and the final state specifies the new positions of the blocks after the execution of the plan. The actions described for the agents are sufficient to achieve the final state. Specifically, one agent can move block b3 from position (3,3) to the top of block b1 in position (1,1). The other blocks, b1 and b2, remain in their initial positions. The availability of two agents ensures that the task can be carried out efficiently.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description specifies the initial and final positions of the blocks and the actions that the agents can perform. The low-level description provides the initial positions of the agents and the APIs they can use to perform the actions. The actions described in the low-level description are consistent with the high-level actions, allowing the agents to move blocks from one position to another, from the table to the top of another block, and vice versa. The initial and final states of the blocks and the availability of the agents are also consistent between the high-level and low-level descriptions.
