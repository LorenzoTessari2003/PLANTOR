LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.

The final state of the scenario is not possible given the rules of movement for the agents. Block b3 is described as being on top of block b1 in position (1,1). However, block b1 is also said to be in position (1,1) on the table. This would imply that block b1 is both under block b3 and on the table in the same position, which is not possible as a block cannot be in two states at once. 

The rules allow for a block to be moved on top of another block, but they do not allow for a block to be in the same position as another block on the table. Therefore, the final state where b3 is on top of b1, both occupying position (1,1), cannot be achieved.
