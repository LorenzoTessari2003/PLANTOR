% Positions

% Blocks

block(b3).

```
The knowledge base is updated to include the low-level predicates `ll_arm/1` to represent the agents equipped with a robotic arm, and the `resources/1` predicate to specify that both agents and arms are considered as resources. The low-level predicates are prepended with `ll_` to avoid conflicts with the high-level predicates.
INIT: The updated initial and goal states for the low-level part are as follows:

```init
init_state([
  ll_arm_at(a1, 4, 4),
  ll_arm_at(a2, 5, 5),
  ll_gripper(a1, open),
  ll_gripper(a2, open),
  ll_block_at(b1, 1, 1),
  ll_block_at(b2, 2, 2),
  ll_block_at(b3, 3, 3),
  ll_ontable(b1),
  ll_ontable(b2),
  ll_ontable(b3),
  ll_clear(b1),
  ll_clear(b2),
  ll_clear(b3),
  ll_available(a1),
  ll_available(a2)
]).
```

```goal
goal_state([
  ll_block_at(b1, 1, 1),
  ll_block_at(b2, 2, 2),
  ll_block_at(b3, 1, 1),
  ll_ontable(b1),
  ll_ontable(b2),
  ll_on(b3, b1),
  ll_clear(b2),
  ll_available(a1),
  ll_available(a2)
]).
```

In the updated initial state, we include the positions of the agents' end-effectors using the `ll_arm_at/3` predicate, which represents the position of the arm. We also include the state of the grippers using the `ll_gripper/2` predicate, which represents the state of the gripper (open or closed). The positions of the blocks are represented using the `ll_block_at/3` predicate. The predicates `ll_ontable/1`, `ll_clear/1`, and `ll_available/1` are used to represent the respective states of the blocks, indicating that they are on the table, clear, and available.

In the goal state, we specify the desired positions of the blocks using the `ll_block_at/3` predicate. We also specify the desired states of the blocks using the `ll_ontable/1`, `ll_on/2`, and `ll_clear/1` predicates. Finally, we specify that the agents should remain available using the `ll_available/1` predicate.
ACTIONS: ```ll_actions
ll_action(move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [ll_arm_at(Agent, X1, Y1)],
  [moving_arm(Agent, _, _, _, _, _, _), gripping(Agent, _), releasing(Agent)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Agent), pos(X1, Y1), pos(X2, Y2)],
  [
    add(moving_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    del(ll_arm_at(Agent, X1, Y1))
  ]
).

ll_action(move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [moving_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Agent)],
  [
    del(moving_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    add(ll_arm_at(Agent, X2, Y2))
  ]
).

ll_action(close_gripper_start(Agent),
  [ll_gripper(Agent, open)],
  [moving_arm(Agent, _, _, _, _, _, _), gripping(Agent, _), releasing(Agent), gripped(Agent)],
  [],
  [ll_gripper(Agent)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Agent, open)),
    add(gripping(Agent, _))
  ]
).

ll_action(close_gripper_end(Agent),
  [gripping(Agent, _)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_gripper(Agent)],
  [
    del(gripping(Agent, _)),
    add(gripped(Agent)), add(ll_gripper(Agent, close))
  ]
).

ll_action(open_gripper_start(Agent),
  [gripped(Agent)],
  [moving_arm(Agent, _, _, _, _, _, _), gripping(Agent, _), releasing(Agent)],
  [],
  [ll_gripper(Agent)],
  [
    del(gripped(Agent)), del(ll_gripper(Agent, close)),
    add(releasing(Agent))
  ]
).

ll_action(open_gripper_end(Agent),
  [releasing(Agent)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_gripper(Agent)],
  [
    del(releasing(Agent)),
    add(ll_gripper(Agent, open))

MAPPINGS: Sure! Here are the mappings from high-level actions to low-level actions:
```mappings
mapping(move_table_to_table_start(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
  ]
).

mapping(move_table_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    close_gripper_start(Agent),
    close_gripper_end(Agent)
  ]
).

mapping(move_block_to_table_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
  ]
).

mapping(move_block_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, Block3, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_gripper_start(Agent),
    open_gripper_end(Agent)
  ]
).
```
The mappings are provided for the start actions of the high-level actions. Each high-level action is mapped to one or more low-level actions. The `move_table_to_table_start` high-level action is mapped to the `move_arm_start` and `move_arm_end` low-level actions. The `move_table_to_block_start` high-level action is mapped to the `move_arm_start`, `move_arm_end`, `close_gripper_start`, and `close_gripper_end` low-level actions. The `move_block_to_table_start` high-level action is mapped to the `move_arm_start` and `move_arm_end` low-level actions. The `move_block_to_block_start` high-level action is mapped to the `move_arm_start`, `move_arm_end`, `open_gripper_start`, and `open_gripper_end` low-level actions.
