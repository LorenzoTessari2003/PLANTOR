OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state describes the positions of the blocks, and the
final state describes the positions of the blocks after the execution of the plan. The actions
described for the agents are sufficient to achieve the final state. Specifically, one agent can move
b3 from position (3,3) to the top of b1 in position (1,1). The presence of two agents ensures that
there are enough resources to carry out the task, even though only one agent is needed for this
specific task.

OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description specifies the initial and final
positions of the blocks and the actions that the agents can perform. The low-level
description provides the initial positions of the agents and the APIs they can use to
perform the actions. The actions described in the low-level description are consistent
with the high-level actions, allowing the agents to move the blocks as required. The
initial and final states of the blocks and the availability of the agents are also
consistent between the high-level and low-level descriptions.
