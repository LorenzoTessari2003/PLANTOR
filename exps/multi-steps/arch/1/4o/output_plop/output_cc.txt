HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state provides the positions of the blocks on the table. The goal state describes the desired configuration of the blocks to form an arch, with b1 and b2 as the pillars and b3 as the architrave. The robotic arm's capabilities are clearly defined, including the special condition for placing the architrave, which ensures that the two pillars are built before placing b3 on top. This scenario is feasible given the described actions and conditions.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear goal of constructing an arch using three blocks and specifies the initial and final positions of the blocks. The robotic arm's capabilities are also clearly defined, including the special handling required for placing the architrave.

The low-level description aligns with the high-level description. It specifies the initial positions of the robotic arms and provides the necessary APIs to move the arms and manipulate the blocks. The actions described at the low level are consistent with the high-level actions, ensuring that the robotic arms can perform the required tasks to achieve the goal.
