HL: OK. The high-level scenario is consistent. The description provides the initial positions of the blocks and the desired final positions. It also specifies the allowed movements of the robotic arm, including moving blocks on the table, placing blocks on top of other blocks, and moving blocks from the top of one block to the top of another block. The scenario also mentions that the action to place the last block on top as an architrave should be handled differently, which suggests that there is a specific condition to be checked before performing that action. Overall, the scenario is well-defined and feasible.
LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.
The high-level and low-level descriptions are not consistent. In the high-level description, it is stated that the goal is to build the two pillars with b1 and b2 in positions (6,6) and (7,6), respectively, and place b3 on top of them as an architrave. However, in the low-level description, there is no mention of any specific positions for the blocks or any actions related to building the pillars or placing the architrave. The low-level description only provides information about the initial positions of the agents and their available actions. Therefore, the low-level description does not align with the high-level goal, making the scenario infeasible.
