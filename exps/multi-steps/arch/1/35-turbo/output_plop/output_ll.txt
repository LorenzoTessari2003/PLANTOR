KB: The updated general knowledge base, including the new low-level predicates and resources, is as follows:

```kb
% Positions
pos(1,1).
pos(2,2).
pos(3,3).
pos(6,6).
pos(7,6).

% Blocks
block(b1).
block(b2).
block(b3).

% Agents
agent(a1).

% Arms
ll_arm(a1).

% Resources
resources(agent(_)).
resources(ll_arm(_)).
```

The low-level predicates `ll_arm/1` and `ll_gripper/2` have been added to represent the arms and grippers of the agents, respectively. The `resources` predicate has been updated to include both `agent(_)` and `ll_arm(_)` to indicate that both agents and arms are available resources.
INIT: Sure! Here is the updated initial and goal states for the low-level part:

```init
init_state([
  ll_arm_at(a1, 4, 4),
  ll_gripper(a1, open),
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b3),
  at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,3,3),
  clear(b1), clear(b2), clear(b3),
  available(a1)
]).
```

```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b3),
  on(b3, b1), on(b3, b2),
  at(b1,6,6), at(b2,7,6), at(b3,6,6),
  clear(b1), clear(b2),
  available(a1),
  ll_arm_at(a1, _, _),
  ll_gripper(a1, _)
]).
```

In the updated initial state, we include the predicates `ll_arm_at(a1, 4, 4)` and `ll_gripper(a1, open)` to represent the initial position of the end-effector of agent `a1` and the state of the gripper. We also include the predicates from the high-level initial state.

In the updated goal state, we include the predicates from the high-level goal state, as well as the predicates `ll_arm_at(a1, _, _)` and `ll_gripper(a1, _)` to indicate that we do not care about the final position of the end-effector and the state of the gripper.

Please note that the low-level predicates should not be used inside the low-level actions, as it may lead to errors.
ACTIONS: ```ll_actions
ll_action(move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [ll_arm_at(Agent, X1, Y1)],
  [moving_arm(Agent, _, _, _, _, _, _), gripping(Agent, _), releasing(Agent)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Agent), pos(X1, Y1), pos(X2, Y2)],
  [
    add(moving_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    del(ll_arm_at(Agent, X1, Y1))
  ]
).

ll_action(move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [moving_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)],
  [],
  [],
  [],
  [
    del(moving_arm(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    add(ll_arm_at(Agent, X2, Y2))
  ]
).

ll_action(close_gripper_start(Agent),
  [ll_gripper(Agent, open)],
  [moving_arm(Agent, _, _, _, _, _, _), gripping(Agent, _), releasing(Agent), gripped(Agent)],
  [],
  [ll_gripper(Agent)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Agent, open)),
    add(gripping(Agent, _))
  ]
).

ll_action(close_gripper_end(Agent),
  [gripping(Agent, _)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_gripper(Agent)],
  [
    del(gripping(Agent, _)),
    add(gripped(Agent)), add(ll_gripper(Agent, close))
  ]
).

ll_action(open_gripper_start(Agent),
  [gripped(Agent)],
  [moving_arm(Agent, _, _, _, _, _, _), gripping(Agent, _), releasing(Agent)],
  [],
  [ll_gripper(Agent)],
  [
    del(gripped(Agent)), del(ll_gripper(Agent, close)),
    add(releasing(Agent))
  ]
).

ll_action(open_gripper_end(Agent),
  [releasing(Agent)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_gripper(Agent)],
  [
    del(releasing(Agent)),
    add(ll_gripper(Agent, open))
  ]
).
```
MAPPINGS: Sure! Here are the mappings from high-level actions to low-level actions:
```mappings
mapping(move_table_to_table_start(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
  ]
).

mapping(move_table_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    close_gripper_start(Agent),
    close_gripper_end(Agent)
  ]
).

mapping(move_block_to_table_start(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
  ]
).

mapping(move_block_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
  ]
).

mapping(place_architrave_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, Block3, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X3, Y3),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X3, Y3),
    open_gripper_start(Agent),
    open_gripper_end(Agent)
  ]
).
```
These mappings define the low-level actions that correspond to the start actions of the high-level actions. Each high-level action is mapped to one or more low-level actions, which are responsible for performing the necessary movements and actions of the agents to achieve the high-level action.
