# Report Experiment 1 Arch - 4-128k - 1

## HL KB Generation

In 1 instance, the generation produced the following KB:

```prolog
<kb>
% Define positions on the table
pos(1,1).
pos(2,2).
pos(3,3).
pos(6,6).
pos(7,6).

% Define blocks
block(b1).
block(b2).
block(b3).

% Define the robotic arm as an agent
agent(arm).

% Define resources
resources(agent(_)).

% Define the special action for placing the architrave
% This is not an actual Prolog rule, but a high-level description of the special action
% that should be handled differently in the planning process.
% place_architrave(Agent, Architrave, Pillar1, Pillar2, Pos1, Pos2) :-
%   built_pillar(Pillar1, Pos1),
%   built_pillar(Pillar2, Pos2),
%   free(Agent),
%   free(Architrave),
%   not(on(_, Architrave)),
%   Agent = arm, % The action can only be performed by the robotic arm
%   Pos1 \= Pos2, % Ensure the positions are different
%   adjacent(Pos1, Pos2), % Ensure the positions are adjacent for the architrave
%   ... % Additional conditions and effects to place the architrave
</kb>
```

which would have been correct if not for the wrong tag.
