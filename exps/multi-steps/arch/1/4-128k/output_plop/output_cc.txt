HL: OK.
The scenario described is feasible given the capabilities of the robotic arm. The robotic arm can move blocks around on the table, stack them on top of each other, and also move them from the top of one block to another location or on top of another block. The goal is to create two pillars and then place a third block on top as an architrave, which is a different action that requires checking the stability of the pillars. Since the robotic arm has the described capabilities and there is a special action to handle the placement of the architrave, the scenario seems consistent and feasible.
LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM. The high-level description of the scenario specifies that the action to place the last block on top as an architrave should be handled differently than the other moves, as it must check that the two pillars have been built. However, the low-level description does not provide a specific API or action that would handle this unique check. The provided APIs only include moving the arm and operating the gripper, which are not sufficient to ensure the condition of having two pillars built before placing the architrave is met. There needs to be a specific low-level action that can verify the condition of the pillars before placing the architrave on top.
