HL: OK. The high-level scenario is feasible. The description provides the initial positions of the blocks and the goal state, which is to build an arch using the blocks. The actions that the robotic arm can perform are clearly defined, including the special action to place the last block on top as an architrave. The scenario is well-defined and consistent.
LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.
The high-level and low-level descriptions are not consistent. In the high-level description, it is stated that the goal is to build the two pillars with b1 and b2 in positions (6,6) and (7,6), respectively, and place b3 on top of them as an architrave. However, in the low-level description, there is no mention of any specific positions for the blocks or any actions related to building the pillars or placing the architrave. The low-level description only includes generic actions for moving the arm and opening/closing the gripper. Therefore, the low-level description does not align with the high-level goal and requirements of the scenario.
