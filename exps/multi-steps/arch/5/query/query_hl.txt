In this scenario, we aim to construct three arches using 20 blocks and 5 robotic arms. The blocks
are initially scattered across the table at various positions, including (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4),
(5,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,8), (9,9), (10,10), (2,1), (4,2), (6,3), (8,4), (10,5), (12,6), (14,7),
(16,8), (18,9), and (20,10). 

The goal is to build:

- An arch at (5,8) and (6,8) using b1 and b2 for the left pillar, b3 and b4 for the right pillar, and b5 as the architrave. 
- An arch at (10,8) and (11,8) using b6, b7, and b8 for the left pillar, b9 and b10 for the right pillar, and b11 as the architrave.
- An arch at (15,8) and (16,8) using b12 and b13 for the left pillar, b14 and b15 for the right pillar, and b16 as the architrave.

The robotic arms can manipulate the blocks in the following ways:

- Move a block from a position on the table to another position on the table.
- Move a block from a position on the table to the top of another block.
- Move a block from the top of a stack to a position on the table.
- Move a block from the top of one stack to the top of another stack.

The placement of the final block as an architrave requires a specific handling process to ensure
both pillars are completed before the block is placed. Coordination among the 5 robotic arms is
essential to efficiently construct all three arches.
