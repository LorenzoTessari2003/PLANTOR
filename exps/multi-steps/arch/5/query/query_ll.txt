Let the blocks and their positions be described in the high-level part.
There are 5 available agents that can carry out the task. They are available at the beginning and
will be available at the end. The agents are actually robotic arm that can pick up blocks and move
them around. At the beginning, the arms are in positions (10,10), (11,11), (12,12), (13,13), (14,14).
We do not care were they are at the end. The low_level actions that they can perform are: 
- move_arm(arm, x1, y1, x2, y2), which makes the robotic arm move from position (x1,y1) to position (x2,y2).
- close(arm), which makes the gripper close.
- open(arm), which makes the gripper open.
Remember to use the appropriate tags for the code you produce and not to use Prolog tags.
