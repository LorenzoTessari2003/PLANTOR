HL: 
OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state describes the positions of the blocks and the agents. The final state describes the new positions of the blocks after the rearrangements. The actions described for the agents are sufficient to achieve the final state from the initial state. Specifically, the agents can move blocks from one position to another and stack blocks on top of each other, which allows them to rearrange the blocks as described. The presence of two agents allows for the necessary movements to be performed efficiently.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear initial and final 
state for the blocks, and the actions described are feasible with the given agents. The 
low-level description aligns with the high-level description, providing detailed actions 
that the robotic arms can perform to achieve the desired rearrangement of the blocks. The 
initial positions of the arms are given, and it is stated that their final positions do 
not matter, which is consistent with the high-level description. The actions available to 
the robotic arms (moving, closing, and opening the gripper) are sufficient to perform the 
required tasks.
