HL: OK.
The high-level scenario is consistent. It provides a clear goal of constructing an arch using 3 blocks and a robotic arm. The initial positions of the blocks are specified, as well as their dimensions. The actions that the robotic arm can perform are described, including moving blocks on the table, placing blocks on top of other blocks, and moving blocks from the top of a block to the table or to the top of another block. The scenario also mentions that the action to place the last block as an architrave should be handled differently, by checking that the two pillars have been built. Overall, the scenario is well-defined and consistent.
LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM. 
The high-level and low-level descriptions are inconsistent. In the high-level description, it is stated that the robotic arm can move blocks from a position on the table to another position on the table, from a position on the table to the top of another block, from the top of a block to a position on the table, and from the top of a block to the top of another block. However, in the low-level description, the only available actions for the agents are to move the end-effector and to open/close the gripper. There is no explicit action to move a block from the table to the top of another block or vice versa. Therefore, the low-level description does not provide the necessary actions to carry out the high-level task.
