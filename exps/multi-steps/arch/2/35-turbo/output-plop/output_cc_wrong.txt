HL: OK. The high-level scenario is consistent. It provides a clear goal of constructing an arch using 3 blocks and a robotic arm. The initial positions of the blocks are specified, as well as the desired final positions for the pillars and the architrave. The capabilities of the robotic arm are also described, including the ability to move blocks on the table, stack blocks on top of each other, and check the state of the pillars before placing the architrave. Overall, the scenario is well-defined and feasible.
LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM. 
The high-level and low-level descriptions are inconsistent. In the high-level description, it is stated that the robotic arm can move blocks from a position on the table to another position on the table, from a position on the table to the top of another block, from the top of a block to a position on the table, and from the top of a block to the top of another block. However, in the low-level description, the only available actions for the agents are to move the end-effector and to open/close the gripper. There is no explicit action to move a block or to place a block on top of another block. Therefore, the low-level description does not provide the necessary actions to achieve the high-level goal.
