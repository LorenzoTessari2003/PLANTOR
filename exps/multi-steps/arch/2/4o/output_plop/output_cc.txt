HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state provides the positions of the blocks and their dimensions. The goal state describes the desired configuration of the blocks to form an arch. The robotic arm's capabilities are clearly defined, including the special condition for placing the architrave block b3 on top of the pillars formed by b1 and b2. The scenario is feasible given the provided actions and conditions.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear goal of constructing an arch using three blocks and specifies the initial and final positions of the blocks. The robotic arm's capabilities are also described, including the special handling required for placing the architrave block.

The low-level description aligns with the high-level description. The initial positions of the blocks and the agents are provided, and the agents have the necessary APIs to perform the required actions. The move_arm, close_gripper, and open_gripper functions are sufficient to move the blocks as described in the high-level scenario. The special handling for placing the architrave can be implemented by checking the positions of the pillars before executing the move.
