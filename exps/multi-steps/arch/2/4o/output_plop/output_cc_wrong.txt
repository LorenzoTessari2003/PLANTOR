HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state specifies the positions of the blocks, and the goal state specifies the desired positions for the blocks to form an arch. The robotic arm's capabilities are clearly defined, including the special condition for placing the architrave block. The dimensions of the blocks are also specified, ensuring that the blocks can be stacked as described. The scenario is feasible given the provided information.
LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM.
The scenario is not feasible. The high-level description specifies that the action to place the last block as an architrave should be handled differently, ensuring that the two pillars have been built. However, the low-level description does not provide any specific API or mechanism to check the state of the pillars before placing the architrave. This inconsistency means that the low-level description lacks the necessary functionality to ensure the correct construction of the arch.
