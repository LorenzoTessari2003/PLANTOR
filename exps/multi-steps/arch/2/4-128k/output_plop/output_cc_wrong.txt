PROBLEM.

The scenario describes the goal of constructing an arch with three blocks using a robotic arm. However, there is an issue with the final positions of the blocks. Blocks b1 and b2 are supposed to form the pillars of the arch at positions (6,6) and (9,6), respectively. Given that each block has a dimension of 1x1x1, placing block b3 on top of them as an architrave would not be structurally possible because there would be a gap between the two pillars. The blocks would not touch each other, and b3 would have no support in the middle to form a stable arch.

For a stable arch, the pillars (b1 and b2) need to be adjacent or have a supporting structure between them that would allow b3 to be placed on top without falling through. Since the scenario does not mention any additional supporting structures and the blocks are 1x1x1, it is not possible to place b3 on top of b1 and b2 with a gap between them.
