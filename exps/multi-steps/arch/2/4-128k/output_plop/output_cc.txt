HL: OK.
The scenario described is feasible and the description is consistent. The blocks are initially on the table, and the robotic arm has the capability to move the blocks to the required positions to build the arch. The dimensions of the blocks are given, and it is specified that b1 and b2 will serve as the pillars, while b3, being longer, will be the architrave. The description of the robotic arm's capabilities covers all necessary movements to achieve the goal. The special handling of the action to place the architrave is noted, which implies that there is a check in place to ensure the pillars are built before placing b3. The description does not contain any contradictions or impossibilities based on the information provided.
LLM has not correctly understood the scenario or there is a problem in the scenario
PROBLEM. The high-level description of the scenario specifies that the action to place the last block (b3, the architrave) on top of the two pillars (b1 and b2) should be handled differently than the other moves, as it must check that the two pillars have been built. However, the low-level description does not provide a specific API or action that would handle this different requirement. The provided APIs (`move_arm`, `close_gripper`, `open_gripper`) do not include any functionality for checking the state of the construction (i.e., whether the two pillars have been built) before placing the architrave.

To ensure consistency and feasibility, the low-level description should include an API that can check the conditions required for the architrave to be placed, or the high-level description should not specify that the action should be handled differently. Without this, there is no way to guarantee that the architrave will only be placed when the pillars are ready.
