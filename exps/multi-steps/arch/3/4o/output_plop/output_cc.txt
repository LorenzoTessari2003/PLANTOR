HL: OK.
The description is consistent. The initial state describes the positions of the blocks and the agents. The final state describes the new positions of the blocks after the rearrangements. The actions that the agents can perform are clearly defined and are sufficient to achieve the final state from the initial state. The two agents can work together to move the blocks as described, making the scenario feasible.
LLM has correctly understood the scenario
OK.
The scenario is consistent. The high-level description provides a clear initial and final 
state for the blocks, and the actions described are feasible with the given agents. The 
low-level description provides detailed actions that the robotic arms can perform, which 
align with the high-level actions. The initial positions of the arms are given, and it is 
stated that their final positions do not matter, which is acceptable. The robotic arms 
have the necessary capabilities to move the blocks as described in the high-level 
scenario.
