INIT: Sure. Here is the updated initial and final states reflecting the changes in the description for the low-level part:

```init
init_state([
  ontable(a), on(b, a), on(c, b), on(d, c),
  at(a, 1, 1), at(b, 1, 1), at(c, 1, 1), at(d, 1, 1),
  clear(d),
  available(a1), available(a2),
  ll_arm_at(a1, 0, 0), ll_arm_at(a2, 3, 3),
  ll_gripper(a1, open), ll_gripper(a2, open)
]).
```

```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(a), ontable(b), ontable(c), on(d, a),
  at(a, 1, 1), at(b, 2, 1), at(c, 3, 1), at(d, 1, 1),
  clear(d), clear(b), clear(c),
  available(a1), available(a2),
  ll_arm_at(a1, _, _), ll_arm_at(a2, _, _),
  ll_gripper(a1, _), ll_gripper(a2, _)
]).
```

In the initial state, we added the positions of the robotic arms (`ll_arm_at/3`) and the state of the grippers (`ll_gripper/2`). In the goal state, we used wildcards (`_`) to indicate that we do not care about the final positions of the arms and the state of the grippers.
ACTIONS: Sure, here is the low-level actions set based on the provided description:

```ll_actions
ll_action(move_arm_start(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [ll_arm_at(Arm, X1, Y1)],
  [ll_moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _), ll_gripping(Arm, _), ll_releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm), pos(X1, Y1), pos(X2, Y2)],
  [
    add(ll_moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    del(ll_arm_at(Arm, X1, Y1))
  ]
).

ll_action(move_arm_end(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [ll_moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_moving_arm(Arm, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)),
    add(ll_arm_at(Arm, X2, Y2))
  ]
).

ll_action(close_start(Arm),
  [ll_gripper(Arm, open)],
  [ll_moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _), ll_gripping(Arm, _), ll_releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Arm, open)),
    add(ll_closing(Arm))
  ]
).

ll_action(close_end(Arm),
  [ll_closing(Arm)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_closing(Arm)),
    add(ll_gripper(Arm, closed))
  ]
).

ll_action(open_start(Arm),
  [ll_gripper(Arm, closed)],
  [ll_moving_arm(Arm, _, _, _, _), ll_gripping(Arm, _), ll_releasing(Arm)],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_gripper(Arm, closed)),
    add(ll_opening(Arm))
  ]
).

ll_action(open_end(Arm),
  [ll_opening(Arm)],
  [],
  [],
  [ll_arm(Arm)],
  [
    del(ll_opening(Arm)),
    add(ll_gripper(Arm, open))
  ]
).
```

This set of low-level actions includes the actions for moving the arm, closing the gripper, and opening the gripper, as described in the query. Each action has a start and end phase, and the preconditions and effects are specified accordingly.
MAPPINGS: Sure. Here are the mappings from high-level actions to low-level actions:

```mappings
mapping(move_table_to_table_start(Agent, Block, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent),
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent),
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).

mapping(move_table_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent),
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent),
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).

mapping(move_onblock_to_table_start(Agent, Block1, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent),
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent),
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).

mapping(move_onblock_to_block_start(Agent, Block1, Block2, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
  [
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X1, Y1),
    close_start(Agent),
    close_end(Agent),
    move_arm_start(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    move_arm_end(Agent, X1, Y1, X2, Y2),
    open_start(Agent),
    open_end(Agent)
  ]
).
```

These mappings ensure that the high-level actions are translated into the appropriate sequence of low-level actions. Each high-level action is mapped to a series of low-level actions that involve moving the arm to the block's position, closing the gripper to pick up the block, moving the arm to the target position, and opening the gripper to release the block.
