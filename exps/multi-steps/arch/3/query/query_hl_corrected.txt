In this scenario, we want to construct two arches using 6 blocks and two robotic arm. The blocks are
initially distributed on the table in positions (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (2,1), (4,2) and (5,3). The 
goal is to build:
- an arch with the pillars in position (6,6) and (7,6) using b1 and b4, respectively, and b5 as the architrave
- an arch with the pillars in position (10,6) and (11,6) using b2 and b3, respectively, and b6 as the architrave
The robotic arm can move the blocks:
- from a position on the table to another position on the table;
- from a position on the table, to the top of another block;
- from the top of a block, to a position on the table;
- from the top of a block, to the top of another block.
The action to place the last block on top as an architrave should be handled differently than these 
moves as it must check that the two pillars have been built.
