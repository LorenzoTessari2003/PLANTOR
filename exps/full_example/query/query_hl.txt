In this scenario, we want to construct an arch using 3 blocks and a robotic arm. The blocks are
initially distributed on the table in positions (32,60), (113,83), and (44,40). Blocks b1 and b2 have 
dimensions 1x1x1 whereas b3 is longer and is considered as an architrave. The goal is to build
the two pillars with b1 and b2 in positions (86,52) and (72,52), respectively, and place b3 on top of 
them as an architrave in position (79, 52). There are two agents can move the blocks:
- from a position on the table to another position on the table;
- from a position on the table, to the top of another block;
- from the top of a block, to a position on the table;
- from the top of a block, to the top of another block.
The action to place the last block on top as an architrave should be handled differently than these 
moves as it must check that the two pillars have been built.
