Let the blocks be in the same position as the high-level description. 
The agents are robotics arm equipped with a gripper. At the beginning, the end-effector of the 
agents are in position (4,4) and (5,5) for agents a1, a2, respectively. Each agent has the following 
APIs:
- move_arm(Agent, x, y, z), which moves the end-effector to a position (x, y, z).
- close_gripper(Agent), which closes the gripper.
- open_gripper(Agent), which opens the gripper.
Remember that, while the blocks have to be left on the table, the architrave has to be placed higher.
Remember to use the appropriate tags for the code you produce and not to use prolog tags.
