system: Given a robotic problem, produce knowledge base in Prolog format as described in the examples. If you notice something unfeasible write PROBLEM in the answer. 
user: How is your code divided?

assistant: The knowledge base is composed of 4 parts:
- `init` section, which contains the initial state of the environment;
- `goal` section, which contains the final state of the environment;
- `KB` section, which contains all the information that is not modified by the actions;
- `actions` section, which contains the description of the actions that can be performed by the agents.

For example, the predicate `available(A)`, which states that the agent A is available, is a predicate that is modified by the actions and should be placed in the `init` section.
On the other hand, the predicate `pos(X,Y)`, which states that the position (X,Y) is a possible position for the agents, is a predicate that is not modified by the actions and should be placed in the `KB` section.

user: How do you describe the structure of an action?

assistant: In our knowledge base, every action is spilt into 'start' and 'end' actions.
Our knowledge base is composed of predicates to describe the states, and Prolog rules that describe the actions leveraging the following structure:
```prolog
action(
  Name(Argument1, Argument2, ...), 
  ValidConditions, 
  InvalidConditions, 
  InvalidConditionsAtEnd, 
  ConditionsOnKB, 
  Effects
)
```
The variable Name defines the name of the action and its argument, e.g., for the action corresponding to the gripping of an agent on a block, we use Name=grip(Agent,Block).
The five variables that follow are lists of conditions that must be checked before deciding whether to add the action or not:                     
- `ValidConditions` is a list containing conditions that should be verified in the current state;
- `InvalidConditions` is a list containing conditions that must not be verified in the current state;
- `ValidConditionsAtEnd` is a list containing conditions that, if present in the current state AND in the goal, prevent the action from being chosen;
- `ConditionOnKB` is a list containing conditions that must be verified on the knowledge base before deciding on the action.
- `Effects` is a list containing predicates on how to modify the current state in a new state. Each predicate is in the form of either add(P(...)), which adds P(...) to the state, or del(P(...)), which looks for P(...) in the current state and removes it.

The list ValidConditionsAtEnd checks if a condition from the goal has already been achieved and avoids actions which may make one of the contained conditions not to hold.
ConditionOnKB is a list used to force the Prolog interpreter to ground the variables of the action to some values.

For example, in the knowledge base there may be predicates describing the possible positions in which blocks may be placed: 
- `pos(1,2)` indicates the position at coordinates (1,2);
- `pos(0,0)` indicates the position at coordinates (0,0).

user: What information should be placed in the `KB`? 

assistant: In the `KB` section, one should place all those pieces of information that are important for the execution of the actions, yet they are not modified by the same actions. 
For example, one could place the available positions inside the knowledge base so that the planner knows which are the positions that can be used, but at the same time it uses other predicates to state that they are free or being used. 
```KB
:-discontiguous pos/2.
:-discontiguous wheeled/1.
pos(1,2).
pos(2,3).
pos(3,4).
wheeled(a1).
wheeled(a3).
```
In this knowledge base, we are saying that there three possible positions the robots can move to/from and that agents a1 and a3 are wheeled robots. 

user: How are the initial and final state written?

assistant: The initial and final states should contain all those predicates that are used to describe the state of the environment and of the agents at the beginning and at the end. It must not contain predicates that state general information regarding the environment, such as abilities of the agents, positions on the map, total number of appliances, etc.
For example, the following initial state is correct as it contains predicates describing information destined to change.

```init
[at(a1, 1, 2), available(a1), available(a2), (at, 2, 3)]
```

```KB
:-discontiguous agent/1.
:-discontiguous pos/2.
agent(a1).
agent(a2).
pos(1,2).
pos(2,3).
pos(3,4).
```

Though the following state is not correct:

```init
[pos(1,2), pos(2,3), pos(3,4), at(a1, 1, 2), available(a1), available(a2), (at, 2, 3)]
```

```KB
:-discontiguous agent/1.
agent(a1).
agent(a2).
```

As the information regarding the available positions should be stated in the `KB` section since the positions remain the same.

user: Can you generate a Prolog snippet of code that describes the initial and final states? 
Given an initial state in which there are two blocks b1, b2 in position (1,1) and (2,2) 
respectively, move the block b1 to position (3,3) and place b2 on top of b1 using an 
agent, which is initially available and it will also be available at the end.

assistant: Sure. The problem states that at the beginning there are two blocks on the table: we shall 
use the `ontable(Block)` predicate to describe this. To state the position of the blocks
we'll use the predicate `at(Block, X, Y)`. Since both blocks do not have a block over them
they are clear to be picked-up, so we use the predicate `clear(Block)` to describe this. 
Finally, the agent is available at the beginning, so we'll use the predicate 
`available(Agent)`.
Here it the initial state in Prolog:
```init
init_state([
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2),
  at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), 
  clear(b1), clear(b2),
  available(a1)
]).
```

At the end, the problem state that block b2 is on top of block b1, so we'll use the
predicate `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` to describe that `BlockTop` is on top of 
`BlockBottom`. Notice that now only b2 will be pickable, hence we'll have the predicate
`clear(b2)`, but not the predicate `clear(b1)`. 
Here is the Prolog code for the goal state:
```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(b1),
  on(b2,b1),
  at(b1,3,3), at(b2,3,3), 
  clear(b2),
  available(a1)
]).

Given an initial state in which there are two blocks b1, b2 on the table in positions 
(1,1) and (2,2), respectively, and a third block b3 on top of b1 in position (1,1), move 
the block b3 on top of b2 using an agent, which is initially available and it will also be 
available at the end.

assistant: Sure. The problem states that at the beginning there are two blocks on the table: we shall 
use the `ontable(Block)` predicate to describe this. It also says that there is a block,
namely b3, which is on top of b1, so we'll use the predicate `on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)`
to specify that `BlockTop` is positioned above `BlockBottom`. To state the position of the
blocks we'll use the predicate `at(Block, X, Y)`. Since both blocks do not have a block
over them they are clear to be picked-up, so we use the predicate `clear(Block)` to 
describe this. Finally, the agent is available at the beginning, so we'll use the 
predicate `available(Agent)`.
Here it the initial state in Prolog:

init_state([

  at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,1,1),
  clear(b3), clear(b2),
  available(a1)
]).
```

At the end, the problem state that block b3 is on top of block b2, so we'll have that 
b3 is on top of b2. Notice that now only b3 will be pickable, hence we'll have the 
predicate `clear(b3)`, but not the predicate `clear(b2)`. We'll also have that b1 is
clear since it does not have any block on top of it anymore. 
Here is the Prolog code for the goal state:
```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2), on(b3,b2),
  at(b1,1,1), at(b2,2,2), at(b3,2,2),

Given an initial state in which there are four blocks b1, b2, b3, b5 on the table in

position (3,3), move the block b2 on top of b1, b3 on top of b2 and place b5 on the table 
in position (0,0) and b4 on the table in position (3,3). The agent is initially available

]).
```

At the end, the problem state that block b2 is on top of block b1 and b3 is on top of b2
forming a pillar so we'll have two predicates `on(b2,b1)` and `on(b3,b2)`. Also, blocks
b4 and b5 are now on the table. Notice that b3, b4 and b5 will be pickable, hence we'll 
have the predicate `clear(Block)`, for the three blocks, but not for b1 or b2. We'll also

example the agents, that is, those predicates that carry out tasks.
Given an initial state in which there are four blocks b1, b2, b3, b5 on the table in 
positions (2,2), (1,1), (3,3), (4,4), respectively, and a fifth block b4 on top of b3 in 
position (3,3), move the block b2 on top of b1, b3 on top of b2 and place b5 on the table 
in position (0,0) and b4 on the table in position (3,3). The agent is initially available 
and it will also be available at the end.

assistant: Sure. The problem states that there are 4 blocks at the beginning and 4 blocks at the end,
so each block is static part of the knowledge base since they are not removed or added 
during the actions. We'll use the predicate `block(Block)` to describe this. The scenario
also describes some positions on a table, which are immutable by definition, so we'll use
the predicate `pos(X, Y)` to describe this. Finally, the description talks about an agent
which carries out actions. This agent is not removed from the description of the state, so
it is a static part of the knowledge base, and we'll use the predicate `agent(Agent)` to
describe it. Finally, since the agent is what carries out the actions, we'll use the
predicate `resources(agent(_))` to describe that whatever agent we consider, that is a 
resource. 
Here it the static knowledge base in Prolog:
```kb
% Positions
pos(1,1).

There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in

on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on  top of block b2 in position 
(4,4). After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on top
of block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the 
same positions as in the initial state. Other blocks, such as b6, are assigned random 
positions on the table. Please explicitly assign these positions.
There are 8 agents with a robotic arm.

user: Can you provide the initial and final states for the following scenario? 
There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in

on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on  top of block b2 in position 
(4,4). After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on top
of block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the 
same positions as in the initial state. Other blocks, such as b6, are assigned random 
positions on the table. Please explicitly assign these positions.
There are 8 agents with a robotic arm. 

assistant: Sure, here is the description of the initial and final states
```init
init_state([
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b4), ontable(b6), ontable(b7),
  on(b5, b1), on(b3, b2), 
  at(b1,2,2), at(b2,4,4), at(b4,8,8), at(b5,2,2), at(b3,4,4), at(b6,1,1), at(b7,3,3),

  available(a1), available(a2), available(a3), available(a4), available(a5), available(a6), available(a7), available(a8)
]).
```
We can see that the initial state describes the positions of the blocks on the table. The
description says that there are 7 blocks and provides the position for the first 5 blocks. 
Their position is then reported by using a combination of the predicates `ontable(Block)`,
`on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` and `at(Block, X, Y)`. The blocks that are not on top of
another block are described as clear to be picked-up by the agent, hence the predicate
`clear(Block)` is used. The agent is available at the beginning, so the predicate
`available(Agent)` is used. Also notice that the description clearly states that the 
position of the remaining blocks, which in this case are b6 and b7, must be assigned 
randomly, hence we have given the blocks two positions on the table that are not used by 
the other blocks and that do not interfere. 

```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b4), ontable(b6), ontable(b7),
  on(b5, b4), on(b3, b2),

  available(a1), available(a2), available(a3), available(a4), available(a5), available(a6), available(a7), available(a8)
]).
```
The final state describes the positions of the blocks on the table after the actions have
been carried out. The description states that b5 was the only block that was moved, and
it was placed on top of b4. The positions of the blocks that were not moved are the same
as in the initial state and must be reported. The positions of the remaining blocks, b6
and b7, are also reported as in the initial state since they belong to the remaining 
blocks that were not moved. The agents are still available at the end, so the predicate
`available(Agent)` is used.

We can see that the initial state describes the positions of the blocks on the table. The
description says that there are 7 blocks and provides the position for the first 5 blocks. 
Their position is then reported by using a combination of the predicates `ontable(Block)`,
`on(BlockTop, BlockBottom)` and `at(Block, X, Y)`. The blocks that are not on top of
another block are described as clear to be picked-up by the agent, hence the predicate
`clear(Block)` is used. The agent is available at the beginning, so the predicate
`available(Agent)` is used. Also notice that the description clearly states that the 
position of the remaining blocks, which in this case are b6 and b7, must be assigned 
randomly, hence we have given the blocks two positions on the table that are not used by 
the other blocks and that do not interfere. 

```goal
goal_state([
  ontable(b1), ontable(b2), ontable(b4), ontable(b6), ontable(b7),
  on(b5, b4), on(b3, b2),
  at(b1,2,2), at(b2,4,4), at(b3,4,4), at(b4,8,8), at(b5,8,8), at(b6,1,1), at(b7,3,3),
  clear(b1), clear(b3), clear(b5), clear(b6), clear(b7),
  available(a1), available(a2), available(a3), available(a4), available(a5), available(a6), available(a7), available(a8)
]).
```
The final state describes the positions of the blocks on the table after the actions have
been carried out. The description states that b5 was the only block that was moved, and
it was placed on top of b4. The positions of the blocks that were not moved are the same
as in the initial state and must be reported. The positions of the remaining blocks, b6
and b7, are also reported as in the initial state since they belong to the remaining 
blocks that were not moved. The agents are still available at the end, so the predicate
`available(Agent)` is used.

Given that the previous messages are examples, you know have to produce code for the task that follows.

    There are 7 blocks on a table. In the initial state of the simulation, block b1 is in position (2,2), block b2 is in 
    position (4,4), block b4 is in position (8,8). Block b5 is on top of block b1 in position (2,2) and block b3 is on 
    top of block b2 in position (4,4). After moving the blocks around during the simulation, at the end, we have b5 on 
    top of block b4, both in position (8,8), and the remaining blocks b1, b2 and b3 are in the same positions as in the 
    initial state. Other blocks, such as b6, are assigned random positions on the table. Please explicitly assign
    these positions.
    There are 8 agents with a robotic arm.

Write the initial and final states, minding to include all the correct predicates. Remember to wrap it into "init" and "goal" tags and not prolog tags.
