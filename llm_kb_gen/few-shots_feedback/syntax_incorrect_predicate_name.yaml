          ```Prolog
          action(make_coffee_start(Client, Coffee, To_go),
              [paid(Client, Coffee, To_go)],
              [],
              [],
              [],
              [del(pad(Client, Coffee, To_go)), add(making(Client, Coffee, To_go))]
          ).

          action(make_coffee_end(Client, Coffee, To_go),
              [making(Client, Coffee, To_go)],
              [],
              [],
              [],
              [del(making(Client, Coffee, To_go)), add(made(Client, Coffee, To_go))]
          ).
          ```
          The action templates in the above Prolog code represent the steps involved in a process of making coffee for a client.
          Specifically, they describe start and end actions for the coffee-making process.

          However the name of the predicate in the `del` effect of the `make_coffee_start` action is wrong. It should be `paid(Client, Coffee, To_go)` instead of `pad(Client, Coffee, To_go)`.
          Can you correct the above Prolog code accordingly?

          Sure, here's the corrected Prolog code with the appropriate predicate in the `del` effect of the `make_coffee_start` action:
          ```Prolog
          action(make_coffee_start(Client, Coffee, To_go),
              [paid(Client, Coffee, To_go)],
              [],
              [],
              [],
              [del(paid(Client, Coffee, To_go)), add(making(Client, Coffee, To_go))]
          ).

          action(make_coffee_end(Client, Coffee, To_go),
              [making(Client, Coffee, To_go)],
              [],
              [],
              [],
              [del(making(Client, Coffee, To_go)), add(made(Client, Coffee, To_go))]
          ).

          Specifically, they describe start and end actions for the coffee-making process.

          However the name of the predicate in the `add` effect of the `make_coffee_start` action is wrong. It should be `making(Client, Coffee, To_go)` instead of `cooking(Client, Coffee, To_go)`.
          Can you correct the above Prolog code accordingly?
