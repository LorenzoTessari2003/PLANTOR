{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "\nWe describe each state by a list of predicates, which define the position of the blocks and the status of the agents. \nFor example, ontable(Block, X, Y) describes the fact that a block is on the table at coordinates (X, Y).\navailable(Agent) states that an agent is available to be used.\ngripped(Agent, Block) states that a block is gripped by an agent.\ngripped(_, Block) states that a block is gripped by any agent.\n\nIn our knowledge base, every action is splitted into 'start' and 'end' actions for both durative and instantaneous actions.\nOur knowledge base is composed of predicates to describe the states, and Prolog rules that describe the actions leveraging the following structure:    \n\naction(\n  Name(Argument1, Argument2, ...),\n  [ValidConditions],\n  [InvalidConditions],\n  [InvalidConditionsAtEnd],\n  [ConditionsOnKB],\n  [Effects]\n).\n\nThe variable Name defines the name of the action and its argument, e.g., for the action corresponding to the gripping of an agent on a block, we use Name=grip(Agent,Block).\nThe six variables that follow are lists of conditions that must be checked before deciding whether to add the action or not:\n- ValidConditions contains conditions that should be verified in the current state;\n- InvalidConditions contains conditions that must not be verified in the current state;\n- ValidConditionsAtEnd contains conditions that must not be verified in the goal;\n- ConditionOnKB contains conditions that must be verified on the knowledge base before deciding on the action.\n- Effects contains a list of predicates on how to modify the current state in a new state. Each predicate is in the form of either add(P(...)), which adds P(...) to the state, or del(P(...)), which looks for P(...) in the current state and removes it.\n\nThe predicates added in the 'Effects' of a start action must be present in the 'ValidConditions' of the corresponding end action. An example is the following one:\n```prolog\n% The robot starts to do something\naction(\n  start_action(Agent, Block),\n  [ValidCondition_1(Agent), ValidCondition_2(Block)],\n  [InvalidCondition_1(Agent)],\n  [],\n  [],\n  [add(Effect_1(Agent))]\n).\n% The robot finalize doing something\naction(\n  end_action(Agent, Block),\n  [Effect_1(Agent)],\n  [InvalidCondition_2(Agent)],\n  [],\n  [],\n  [add(Effect_2(Agent))]\n).\n```\n\nThe 'Effect_1(Agent)' effect occurs as a result of the 'start_action'. This is one of the conditions which must be present in the 'ValidConditions' to take the 'end_action'.\n\nThe list ValidConditionsAtEnd checks if a condition from the goal has already been achieved and avoids actions which may make one of the contained conditions not to hold.\nConditionOnKB is a list used to force the Prolog interpreter to ground the variables of the action to some values.\n\nIn particular, the knowledge base is composed of predicates: \n- pos(X,Y), which indicates positions that may be used by the agents to temporarily store blocks;\n- The predicates inside the goal state.\n\nThe reason for adding the goal state to the knowledge base is to avoid adding trivial and useless actions.\nIndeed, the search in Prolog is not guided and if we were not to match the goal when choosing an action, the search would be completely unguided and the program may add useless actions such as the movement of a block in the same position.\nTo query for a solution, we provide the initial and final states as input parameters to the go function.

Ultrasound may also be used to assess blood flow to chest organs.                           \nThe BLUE protocol is a useful chest screening algorithm to identify the cause of acute respiratory distress. According to the BLUE protocol, there are uppper and lower BLUE points on the each side of the chest. The upper BLUE point is a few centimeter below the collarbone and the lower BLUE point is a few centimeters above the nipple. In order to carry out a chest ultrasound examination, the BLUE points must be found on both right and left part of the chest.                           \n\nHere are the steps of the ultrasound chest examination:\n1. Human-body positioning: The robot transfers the patient from his or her old position(seated) to a new position(supine). It is enough for patient to be positioned once in the supine position only by single agent(robot)\n2. High-level Scan: Acqire an image of the whole body to know the position of the patient\n3. Model Mapping: Check the acquired image against information about the human body. This is done to check if the image has been acquired preciesely\n4. Find body segmant: The blue point exist in the upper body area. There are four regions of interest in chest where blue points are located: upper segment of right side of the chest, lower segment of right side of the chest, upper segment of left side of the chest, and lower segment of left side of the chest\n5. Detailed video scan: This scan will be conducted in the defined regions of interest to find the blue points\n6. Palpation: Use the tactile sensor to collect information using force feedback from human body \n7. Sensor Fusion: Identify anatomical landmarks by combining the information acquired by the images in the 5th step and tactile sensor in the 6th step\n8. Gel application: (The robot do it) Put the gel on the identified areas\n9. Scan: Scan the identified area to find the blue points. Store these images for further examination from the physician\n"}]}
